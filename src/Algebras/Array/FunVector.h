1 Data Structures for Parameter Functions

The datastructures below may be useful for value mappings of operators
which work with more than one parameter function.

1.1 Class ~FunInfo~

Each object of this class contains a function (given by a Supplier object)
together with some additional information, e.g. an assigned number
(["]function-id["]) and an assigned name.

A function can be requested with given parameters. The system measures, sums up
and prints out the used CPU time of the function. The total number of function
requests is also available.

*/
class FunInfo;

bool operator<(const FunInfo&, const FunInfo&);
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream&, const FunInfo&);

class FunInfo {
  public :
    FunInfo();
    FunInfo(int, string, Supplier);
    double getTime();
    Supplier getSupplier() { return supplier; }
    const string& getName() { return name; }
    void request(Word*, int, Word&, string);
    void request(Word, Word&, string);
    void request(Word, Word, Word&, string);
    void open();

  friend std::ostream& ::operator<<(std::ostream&, const FunInfo&);
};

/*
1.2 Class ~FunVector~

This class uses the class template ["]vector["]. Each object of the class
~FunVector~ contains a vector of ~FunInfo~ objects. The vector is initialized
with a set of functions (given by a Supplier object) and an array of function
names. After initializing the vector, a single function or all functions stored
in the vector may be requested.

The class also provides some useful methods for the implementation of the
switch- and the select algorithm.

    void load(Word, Word*);
    
    void requestFun(int, Word, Word&, string);
    void requestFun(int, Word, Word, Word&, string);
    void requestAll(Word, Word&, string);
    void requestAll(Word, Word, Word&, string);
    
    void open(const size_t pos)  { funInfos[pos].open(); }
    void close(const size_t pos) { funInfos[pos].close(); }

    void closeAll() { sendMsgForAll(CLOSE); }

/*
1.3 Class ~SwitchAlgorithm~

The switch algorithm is implemented as a sub-class of the class ~FunVector~.

An object of the class ~SwitchAlgorithm~ is initialized like an object of the
class ~FunInfo~. For each requests, the switch algorithm chooses the function
with the (so far) lowest total used CPU time.

*/
class SwitchAlgorithm : public FunVector {
  public:
    void request(Word, Word&, string);
    void request(Word, Word, Word&, string);
  private:
    int counter;
};

/*
1.4 Class ~SelectAlgorithm~

The select algorithm is implemented as a sub-class of the class ~FunVector~.

An object of the class ~SelectAlgorithm~ is initialized analogous to an object
of the class ~FunInfo~. In addition to a set of functions, the parameter
~testSize~ has to be set to a number greater than zero. For the first
~testSize~ requests, all functions are used for evaluation. After that, the
function with the (so far) lowest total used CPU time is selected for all
further requests. However, this selection will not be changed later on.

  public:
    SelectAlgorithm();
    void setTestSize(int);
    void request(Word, Word&, string);
