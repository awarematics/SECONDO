[1] Class DServerParamStorage Definition

0 Description

This file contains the defintions for the classes ~DServerParam~ 
and ~DServerParamStorage~. The ~DServerParam~ class is a
baseclass to store parameters used for objects, which will 
be run on the workers. Derived objects should extend this class
and define the parameters they need.
The class ~DServerParamStorage~ is the container baseclass, which provides
methods to store objects derived from the class ~DServerParam~.

IMPORTANT: The class ~DServerParamStorage~ owns the ~DServerParam~ object. 
Therefor it is necessary to make a copy of the ~DServerParam~ object
when setting it in the storage class.

This is needed, because the objects derived from the ~DServerParamStorage~
class are often used in threads. A thread would automatically destory this
object. For porper cleanup this class needs to own the ~DServerParam~ object.

a copy of the parameter object, because this class must have
the ownership of it. The reason is, that
the derived class may run in threads, where the data is
deleted automatically.
