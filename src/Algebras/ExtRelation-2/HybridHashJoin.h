4 Class ~HybridHashJoinProgressLocalInfo~

All classes and functions have been put into the namespace
~extrel2~ to avoid name conflicts with existing implementations and
to make it later easier to replace existing operators.

This class contains the progress information for the implementation
of the ~hybridhashjoin~ operator. As the operator implementation
needs to provide some more progress information during
partitioning phases this class has been derived from
~ProgressLocalInfo~.
