2 Overview

This file contains the declaration of all classes and functions that
implement the ~sortmergejoin2~ operator which uses the new sort
algorithm implemented by operator ~sort2~.

/*
The constructor. Consumes all tuples of the tuple stream ~stream~
immediately into sorted runs of approximately two times the size of the
operators main memory by making use of the replacement selection
algorithm for run generation.The internal main memory sort routine
uses a minimum heap for sorting. For tuple comparisons the algorithm
uses the compare object ~cmpObj~. All progress information will be
stored in ~p~. Additionally the constructor allows to specify the
maximum number of open temporary files during a merge phase, the so
called maximum fan-in ~maxFanIn~ for a merge phase and the maximum
memory ~maxMemSize~ the operator uses for the sort operation. If
~maxMemSize~ is set to UINT\_MAX the sort algorithm uses the maximum
main memory which the operators has been assigned by the query processor.
