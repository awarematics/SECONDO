1 Header File TupleBuffer2.h

June 2009, Sven Jungnickel. Initial version.

2 Overview

Class ~TupleBuffer2~ is a replacement for the class
~TupleBuffer~ in RelationAlgebra. As the former ~TupleBuffer~
has been implemented as a subclass of ~GenericRelation~, which
also allows random access, we have decided to implement the
~TupleBuffer2~ class as a separate new class. The main
differences are

  * Allows only sequential access

  * If the internal buffer overflows not the whole buffer is flushed
to disk, but only the amount of tuples that caused the overflow. Thus
tuples are moved gradually to disk following the FIFO principle.

  * Tuples moved to disk are stored in a temporary ~TupleFile~ (see
RelationAlgebra.h for details)
