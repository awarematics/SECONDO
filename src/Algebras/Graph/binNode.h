This class contains the nodes for the AVL Tree BinTree for the shortestpath
operator. It have the same operators like the BinTree. To be able to balance
the tree it uses 5 private methods to balance the tree and a method to keep
the depth of the nodes actual. At final destruction a method delNode runs 
throw the tree and deletes the nodes from the leaves up to the root.
