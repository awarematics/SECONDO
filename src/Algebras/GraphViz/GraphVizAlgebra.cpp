1 Overview

This module serves as wrapper for using an optional viewer which
dependens on graphviz and grappa. graphviz is a collection of
layout algorithms offered as command line tools or library. It
translates a graph notated in the so called DOT language into
several output formats.

Here we will use simply a textual output format which contains the
calculated node placement information and use the java package grappa
for displaying those graphs.

For further information please consult www.graphviz.org.

Currently this algebra contains only one operator called 
~lastoptree~ which returns a ~dot~ object for the last operator
tree if debug mode 1 is activated. Later it will be extended by
a special render operator which may create a graph notation extracted
from a stream of tuples which contains string or text attributes.
