1 TupleQueue

The ~TupleQueue~ is designed as a replacement for the ~TupleBuffer~ structure.
Tuples in the ~TupleBuffer~ cannot be released until the whole query finishes.
This is because when the tuple is cached, it is pinned and it may be used in
several ~tupleBuffer~s.
In this case, all Flobs of cached tuples are also cached within the ~NativeFlobCache~,
and can not be released during the whole query procedure.

This feature causes problem in the ~fetchFlob~ operator, which holds a tupleBuffer
for all tuples that have Flob data need to be fetched from remote DSs.
Since the tuples cannot be released from the buffer although they have been output
to the successive operator, their Flob are also hold the NativeFlobCache all the time,
hence produces unnecessary disk overhead.

Regarding this problem, hereby I created a simple FlobQueue structure as the
replacement for the ~TupleBuffer~.
It is a FIFO structure, when a tuple is returned then its Flob is also released.
It holds a STL vector, named ~mtq~ (memory tuple queue), for the tuples as the memory buffer,
and the overflowed tuples are inserted into a temporal relation structure.
When a tuple is cached into TupleQueue, it makes a copy and the origianl one is deleted,
in order to avoid pining the tuple and the Flob.

It does not support random access, all tuples are read from the top of the structure,
i.e. the ~mtq~. When the ~mtq~ is partial cleaned up, then some tuples are read from the
relation and put into the end of the ~mtq~.

In order to traverse all cached tuples, instead of only fetching the top one,
a stl list is used to take place of the queue structure for the ~mtq~
