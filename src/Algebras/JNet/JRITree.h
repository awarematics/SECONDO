1 class JRITree

The JRITree enables the user to sort and compress sets of JRouteIntervals as
far as possible. It uses an tree embedded in an DbArray to avoid problems
with main memory limitation. For big amounts of data. Therefore the
JRouteIntervals are embedded in JRITReeElements which extend the JRouteInterval
by two pointers to the indexes of their right and left sons.
