1 class ~PQManagement~

Manages the priority queue and the visited sections within shortest path search

main memory limitations. The first DbArray contains the visited Junctions and
the second DbArray the priority queue. The two DbArrays are connected by the
pqindex value stored in the first one for each pqentry. If the junction is not
longer in the priority queue this indexentry is set to -1.
