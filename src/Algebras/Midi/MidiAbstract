[1] Abstract

Midi is a standardized format to provide a way of interchanging time-stamped MIDI data between different programs on the same or different computers. One of the primary design goals was compact representation, which makes it very appropriate for disk-based file format, but less appropriate for quick access by a sequencer program.

This MidiAlgebra introduces Midi files to SECONDO. It is completely integrated into the persistency mechanism of SECONDO. Therefore you can store Midi files inside relations as well as use Midi objects as results of SECONDO queries. We are providing several operators to extract information from Midi files or to create new Midi files depending on the users desire.

The also available MidiViewer is a java-based Viewer using a graphical interface with comparable functionality to SECONDO. The big advantage of the Viewer beyond SECONDO is the opportunity to play Midi files and use additional features e.g. easily mute single tracks of a Midi. There you can also check the results you did to a Midi file using the inside SECONDO implemented operators.
