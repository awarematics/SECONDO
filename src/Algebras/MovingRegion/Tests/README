This directory contains unit tests for the MovingRegionAlgebra. Please
refer to the pdview documentation of MovingRegionAlgebra.cpp for details
on the unit testing concept. 

Before running the tests, you have to build the MovingRegionAlgebra with
the symbol with the MRA_UNITTEST symbol defined so that the specific unit 
testing operators are available. The best place to define this symbol is 
the makefile, where the proper preparations have been already done at the 
head of the file. After editing the makefile, execute the following 
commands:

   cd secondo
   (cd Algebras/MovingRegion; make clean)
   make

If you are getting an unexpected high number of errors for the files

   refinementpartition.tests
   insideabove.tests
   trapeziumintersection.tests,

please check the MRA_UNITTEST symbol has been defined properly.

To run the tests, execute the following commands:

   cd Algebras/MovingRegion/Tests
   make

A summary of the test results will be displayed. See the .out files for
more detailed test results.

Run

   make clean

to delete files created during the test.
