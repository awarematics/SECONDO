1 Introduction

See the documentation of ~PictureAlgebra.h~ for a general introduction to
the Picture algebra.

This module contains the JPEG memory manager. This manager uses the 
jpeg lib to compress the
image data and to decompress jpeg data to a given memory buffer.

 that the next read will cause a ~fill\_input\_buffer~ call that can suspend.

 reset the pointer and count to the start of the buffer, and return TRUE
 indicating that the buffer has been dumped.
 
 In applications that need to be able to suspend compression due to output
 overrun, a ~FALSE~ return indicates that the buffer cannot be emptied now.
 In this situation, the compressor will return to its caller (possibly with
 an indication that it has not accepted all the supplied scanlines).  The
 application should resume compression after it has made more room in the
 output buffer.  Note that there are substantial restrictions on the use of
 suspension --- see the documentation.
 
 When suspending, the compressor will back up to a convenient restart point
 (typically the start of the current MCU). ~next\_output\_byte~ and 
 ~free\_in\_buffer~
 indicate where the restart point will be if the current call returns ~FALSE~.
 Data beyond this point will be regenerated after resumption, so do not
 write it out when emptying the buffer externally.
