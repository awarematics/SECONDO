0 Overview

This little example algebra provides two type constructors ~xpoint~ and
~xrectangle~ and two operators:

  1. ~inside~, which checks whether either a point or a rectangle is
     within a rectangle, and

  2. ~intersects~, which checks two rectangles for intersection.

The file "Algebra.h" is included, since the new algebra must be a subclass of
class Algebra. All of the data available in Secondo has a nested list
representation. Therefore, conversion functions have to be written for this
algebra, too, and "NestedList.h" is needed for this purpose. The result of an
operation is passed directly to the query processor. An instance of
"QueryProcessor" serves for this. Secondo provides some standard data types, e.g.
"CcInt", "CcReal", "CcString", "CcBool", which is needed as the result type of the
implemented operations. To use them "StandardTypes.h" needs to be included.

2.2 List Representation

The list representation of an xpoint is

2.3 ~In~ and ~Out~ Functions

The ~In~-function gets a nested list representation of an ~xpoint~ value passed
in the variable "instance".  It is represented by the C++ type "ListExpr".
Moreover, there is a global pointer variable "nl" which points to the (single)
instance of class ~NestedList~.  This class provides a set of functions which
can investigate and manipulate nested lists. For details refer to the file
"NestedList.h".

The parameter "errorInfo" can be used to return specific
error information if the retrieved list is not correct. In the latter case,
the boolean parameter "correct" needs to be set to false.

The return value of the function is of type ~Word~ which can simply be
regarded as a pointer. The query processor operates with this type-less
abstraction for objects. If all integrity checks are correct we will return
a pointer to a new instance of class ~XPoint~.

it is safe to do it. But in general, type casts can be a source for ~strange~
errors, e.g. segmentation faults, if you cast to a type which is not compatible
to the object that the pointer belongs to.

3 Type Constructor ~xrectangle~

To define the Secondo type ~xrectangle~, we need to (i) define a data
structure, that is a class, to (ii) decide about a nested list representation,
and (iii) write conversion functions from and to nested list representation.
The function for converting from the list representation is the most involved
one, since it has to check that the given list structure is entirely correct.

After we have described the traditional programming interface in the previous
section, here in some places we use more recent alternative programming
interfaces for implementing a type.

3.3 List Representation and ~In~/~Out~ Functions

The list representation of an xrectangle is

----    (XLeft XRight YBottom YTop)
----

In contrast to the code examples above, we use here the class
~NList~ instead of the static functions "nl->f(...)". Its interface is described
in file "NList.h". It is a simple wrapper for calls like "nl->f(...)" and provides
a more object-oriented access to a nested list.

This class was implemented more recently; hence there is a lot of code which uses
the older interface. But as you can observe, the code based on ~NList~ is more
compact, easier to read, understand, and maintain. Thus we recommend to use this
interface.

6 Initialization

Each algebra module needs an initialization function. The algebra manager
has a reference to this function if this algebra is included in the list
of required algebras, thus forcing the linker to include this module.

The algebra manager invokes this function to get a reference to the instance
of the algebra class and to provide references to the global nested list
container (used to store constructor, type, operator and object information)
and to the query processor.

The function has a C interface to make it possible to load the algebra
dynamically at runtime (if it is built as a dynamic link library). The name
of the initialization function defines the name of the algebra module. By
convention it must start with "Initialize<AlgebraName>".

To link the algebra together with the system you must create an
entry in the file "makefile.algebra" and to define an algebra ID in the
file "Algebras/Management/AlgebraList.i.cfg".

/*
7 Examples and Tests

The file "PointRectangle.examples" contains for every operator one example.
This allows one to verify that the examples are running and to provide a coarse
regression test for all algebra modules. The command "Selftest <file>" will
execute the examples. Without any arguments, the examples for all active
algebras are executed. This helps to detect side effects, if you have touched
central parts of Secondo or existing types and operators.

In order to setup more comprehensive automated test procedures one can write a
test specification for the ~TestRunner~ application. You will find the file
"example.test" in directory "bin" and others in the directory "Tests/Testspecs".
There is also one for this algebra.

Accurate testing is often treated as an unpopular daunting task. But it is
absolutely inevitable if you want to provide a reliable algebra module.

Try to write tests covering every signature of your operators and consider
special cases, as undefined arguments, illegal argument values and critical
argument value combinations, etc.
