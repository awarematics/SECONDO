# TestRunner -i importEsriGrid
#
# By default a temporary database directory will be created. 
# If you want to use existing databases run:

# fapra@linux-3vdv:~/secondo/bin> TestRunner --no-tmp -i ../Algebras/Raster2/Import/test/importEsriGrid.test
#

delete database raster2test;

# if a command between the SETUP directive and the first
# TESTCASE directive fails, then the whole test has failed 
# and we immediately skip to the teardown
# (the whole test does not make sense anymore if the 
# SETUP has failed)
