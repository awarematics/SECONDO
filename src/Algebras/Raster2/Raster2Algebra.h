[1] Header File of the Raster2 Algebra


[TOC]

1 Overview

This header file essentially contains the definition of the struct ~Rectangle~.
This class corresponds to the memory representation for the type constructor
~rect~, ~rect3~ and ~rect4~ which are 2-dimensional, 3-dimensional, 4-dimensional
or 8-dimensional rectangles alligned with the axes of each dimension. A rectangle
in such a way can be represented by four, six or eight numbers (two for each dimension).
