  1.1 Constructor RotatingPlane
  
  The class is constructed with two faces sreg and dreg, calculates
  MovingSegments using the Rotating-Plane-Algorithm and stores them into the
  attribute ~face~.
  Furthermore it detects all concavities in the source- and destination-regions
  and puts them in lists (~scvs~ for source- and ~dcvs~ for destination-
  concavities) together with the holes of these faces (holes and concavities
  are treated equal most of the time)
  
  The flag ~evap~ is set, if we currently are in the evaporation-phase, in
  which case the MovingSegments are constructed a little different.
