[1] Implementation file for the class ~NaiveIntersectionAlgorithm~

[TOC]

1 Overview

This file contains the class ~NaiveIntersectionAlgorithm~.

This file is not required for SECONDO. It is only used inside the test project.


This class determines the intersections by testing each segment against 
every other segment.
