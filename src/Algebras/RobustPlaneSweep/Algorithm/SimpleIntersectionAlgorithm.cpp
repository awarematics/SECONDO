[1] Implementation file for the class ~SimpleIntersectionAlgorithm~

[TOC]

1 Overview

This file contains the class ~SimpleIntersectionAlgorithm~.

This file is not required for SECONDO. It is only used inside the test project.

The ~SimpleIntersectionAlgorithm~ is the base class for all test intersection
algorithms. The input and the output are handled inside this class.
