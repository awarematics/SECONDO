[1] Header File for the class ~SimpleSweepIntersectionAlgorithm~

[TOC]

1 Overview

This header file contains all structs and classes required for the
class ~SimpleSweepIntersectionAlgorithm~.

This file is not required for SECONDO. It is only used inside the test project.

This class uses a simple sweep algorithm. There are start- and end-sweep-events.
At a start event, the segment is inserted into a hash table and 
at an end event, the segment is removed. Before a segment is inserted, 
every segment inside the hash table is tested against the inserting segment.
