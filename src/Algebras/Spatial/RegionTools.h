1 RegionTools


This file contains functions handling with regions.


1.1 Function ~buildRegion~

This function creates a region from a vector of cycles.

The cycles must be closed. This means, the first and the
last point must be the same.

The outer cycle of a face must be given in clockwise order.
Inner cycles (holes) must be given in counter-clockwise order.

You can ensure this using code like:

---
  if(  isFace ){
     if(!getDir(cycle)){
         reverseCycle(cycle);
     }
  } else {
       if(getDir(cycle) ){
          reverseCycle(cycle);
       }
  }

/*
1.2 Function ~getDir~

This function returns the direction of a cycle as a boolean value.
It returns true, if the given cycle is in clockwise order. If the
cycle is directed counter clockwise, the result will be false.

1.3 Function reverse cycle

This function changes the direction of a cycle.
