~ComputeMEquality~

This function compoutes the moving equality of two point units defined
over the same time interval. The interval is given by iv. The 
movements of the uints are given by the start and endpoints of both points.
The result is stored in the variable result. If CompValue is set to be 
true, a check of equality is done, otherwise a check for inequality.
