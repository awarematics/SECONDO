2 The Parser Specification

This file is the specification of a parser. It can be used as an 
input file for the parser generator yacc or the open source equivalent
bison. 
The grammar represents a boolean algebra including 

  * operators: and or not xor [=>] [<=>]

  * constants: true false

  * variables: ii ib ie bi bb be ei eb ee


The names of the variables refer to the entries in the 9 intersection matrix.
This means ii=true iff [interior_A][intersection][interior_B] [!=] [emptyset].

The letters have the following meaning:

  * i  the interior

  * b  the boundary

  * e  the exterior

The position of the letter denotes the position of the argument.

This main function provided by this parser is int parseString(char[star] , struct tree[star][star]).
If the string describes a valid boolean expression, the created tree is returned
in the second argument and the result will be 1. If the parsing failed, all created 
subtrees are destroyed automatically. The tree argument is not changed in this case and the
result value will be 0.

2.3 Realization of the automatical destroying of created objects

Some operations called by the parser create new objects. To avoid
memory leaks, its required to destroy the objects in case of an
occured error. To do this, a stack picks up all created objects. 
In the yyerror (here called treeerror) function, all elements in the
stack und also the stack itself are destroyed.
