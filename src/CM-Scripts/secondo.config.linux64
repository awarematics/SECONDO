# SECONDO ENVIRONMENT SETUP FOR LINUX 
#
# Since Feb 2005. M. Spiekermann

# Note: If you plan to try other versions of Berkeley DB, bison, flex, etc
# rename the old one and configure it for installation within the directory
# structure of installsdk which is
#
# $SECONDO_SDK 
#          |-gcc 
#          |-flex 
#          |-bison 
#          |-swi       SWI-Prolog
#          |-bdb       Berkeley-DB 
#          |-auxtools  Auxiliary tools, readline, jpeg-lib, etc 
#
# If you plan to use another directory layout please be careful. Study the
# settings made in the file "secondo.setroot". There the following variables
# are set: 
#
# C_INCLUDE_PATH       // list of paths for compiling C-code 
# CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH   // list of paths for compiling C++-code 
# LIBRARY_PATH         // list of paths for the linker 
# LD_LIBRARY_PATH      // list of paths for shared obejcts (runtime linker)

# For some strange reason the jpee library is not found although it
# is defined in LIBRARY_PATH. Therefore we define some special additional
# linker flags
