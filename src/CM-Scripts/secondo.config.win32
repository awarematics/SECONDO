# SECONDO ENVIRONMENT SETUP FOR MS-WINDOWS
#
# Since Feb 2005. M. Spiekermann

# Note: If you plan to try other versions of Berkeley DB, bison, flex, etc.
# rename the old one and configure it for installation within the directory
# structure of installsdk which is
#
# C:
#  |---\secondo-sdk 
#  |       |-flex 
#  |       |-bison 
#  |       |-bdb       Berkeley-DB
#  |       |-swi       SWI-Prolog 
#  |       |-auxtools  Auxiliary tools, readline, jpeg-lib, etc. 
#  |       
#  |---\mingw
#  |---\msys\1.0\home\$USER
#                       |---secondo
#
# If you plan to use another directory layout please be careful. Study the
# settings made in the file "secondo.setroot". There the following variables
# are set: 
#
# C_INCLUDE_PATH       // list of paths for compiling C-code 
# CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH   // list of paths for compiling C++-code 
# LIBRARY_PATH         // list of paths for the linker 
# LD_LIBRARY_PATH      // list of paths for shared objects # (runtime linker)

# For some strange reason the jpeg library is not found although it
# is defined in LIBRARY_PATH. Therefore we define some special additional
# linker flags
