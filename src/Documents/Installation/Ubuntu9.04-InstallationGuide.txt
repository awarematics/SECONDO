2 Installing Secondo
--------------------

Download Secondo version 3.0 (linux version) from the website:
  http://dna.fernuni-hagen.de/secondo
and unpack the file within your home directory using 
  tar -xzf <file>. 

Create a file ".secondorc" within your home directory having 
the following content:

export SECONDO_PLATFORM=linux64
export SECONDO_BUILD_DIR=$HOME/secondo
export BERKELEY_DB_LIB="db_cxx"
export BERKELEY_DB_DIR=/usr
export J2SDK_ROOT=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.15/
export SWI_HOME_DIR=/usr/lib/swi-prolog
export PL_LIB_DIR=$SWI_HOME_DIR/lib/amd64
export PL_INCLUDE_DIR=$SWI_HOME_DIR/include
export PL_VERSION=50647
export SECONDO_JAVA=$J2SDK_ROOT/bin/java
export readline=true
export PATH=$PATH:.:$SECONDO_BUILD_DIR/Tools/pd
export SECONDO_CONFIG=$SECONDO_BUILD_DIR/bin/SecondoConfig.ini
export JAVAVER=1.6

alias secroot='export SECONDO_BUILD_DIR=$PWD'


If you want to run Secondo on a 32 bit Ubuntu, change the first line to
export SECONDO_PLATFORM=linux
You may also need to adjust some path variables, especially PL_LIB_DIR has to
be set according to your local platform.

Edit your file ".bashrc" located in your home directory by adding the following 
lines:

source .secondorc

Close your terminal and start a new bash. 

After that you have to patch Secondo to run on Ubuntu. To do so, just
call from the bash:
  $HOME/secondo/CM-Scripts/patchUbuntu804

Then you can compile Secondo:

  cd secondo
  make

Read the Secondo User Manual for further instructions and enjoy the
Secondo extensible database system.
