3.1 Constructor

The constructoer is called with two arguments: the tracknumber and the
track itself. It checks the whole track for any meta messages and
evaluates them. By assuming the name of the sequence, the meta message
has the type ~03~. As this message could also describe the tracks name
we assume that the track, to which the sequence name belongs, has a length
of zero ticks. This seems to be the only practicable approach.
