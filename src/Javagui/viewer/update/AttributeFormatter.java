/*
This class is the central instance for formatting attributes within the 
UpdateViewer. Here, the conversion from string into nested list and vice
versa is performed. To do this, we use format classes from the package 
viewer.update.format. To avoid freequently creating of formatting objects, we 
hold an instance for each type occured up to now. Whenever a unknow type is
asked, we look for a format class. If this class is found, we create an
object instance from it for formatting all incoming attributes of this type. 
If no formatting class is found, we use the standard format class converting
a nested list into its string representation. For allowing to add or update 
the formatting at runtime, we introduce a delete method removing all connections
between types and its textual representation.
