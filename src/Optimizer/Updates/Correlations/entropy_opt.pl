September 2005, G. Zimbrao. Initial version.

April 2006, M. Spiekermann. Isolating the changes needed for the entropy optimizer.
Redundant code (code which is also defined in the standard optimizer) removed.
Some parts were merged with the standard optimizer. Moreover a mechanism for
switching between ~standard~ and ~entropy~ optimiztation was implemented in
~calloptimizer.pl~. Finally, the code documentation was revised.

May 2006. M. Spiekermann. Creation and update mechanism for relation objects.
This may be useful for a deeper analysis of the quality of cardinality
estimations.

June 2006. Generic predicates for displaying lists of tuples as formatted tables
added. This helps to get an quick overview about the different estimation values.

4 Predicate ~pl\_maximize\_entropy/3~

This predicate computes conditional probabilities using the
Maximum Entropy approach. It is done by means of the so called iterative
scaling algorithm which is implemented in C++.
The implementation is in the file "iterative\_scaling.cpp".

Usage:

----
    maximize_entropy( [p1 p2 p3 ... pn], [[1, cp1], [2, cp2] ...], R )
----

The parameters are a list of marginal probabilites (e.g. the selectivites on the
sample relations) and a list of conditional probabilities (computed after running
an initial query plan on a small database). It assumed the same coding of
predicates using bits, as done in POG construction - that is, to the predicate
n, if the ith-bit is set to 1 then the ith-predicate is already evaluated.

Each pi is the probability for predicate $2^i$ Each pair [n, cp] is the given
probability cp of joint predicates n using the ith-bit convention above.  The result
is in the form of a list of pairs [n, cp] also.

Example applications:

----
    maximize_entropy([[1, 0.5], [2, 0.5]], [], R).
    R = [[0, 1.0], [1, 0.5], [2, 0.5], [3, 0.25]]

    maximize_entropy([[1, 0.5], [2, 0.5], [4, 0.5]], [[3, 0.4], [6, 0.4]], R).
    R = [ [0, 1.0], [1, 0.5], [2, 0.5], [3, 0.4],
          [4, 0.5], [5, 0.34], [6, 0.4], [7, 0.32] ]
----

In the first case nothing is known about conditional probabilities and the
result is just the product (the independence assumption). In the second case the
remaining unknown conditional selectivites are computed.

~Marginal2~ and ~Joint2~ are adjusted versions of the marginal selectivities ~Marginal~ and the joint selectivities ~Joint~. Adjustments are done to avoid inconsistent settings and zero atoms, to ensure that iterative scaling finds a numeric solution. The basic conditions that need to hold for a conjunction of two predicates "p" and "q" with selectivities "S_p" and "S_q" and the joint selectivity "S_{pq}" are the following:

  1 "S_{pq}" [<=] "S_p"

  2 "S_{pq}" [<=] "S_q"

  3 "S_{pq}" [>=] "S_p + S_q - 1"

If any "S_{pq}" lies outside these bounds it will be set to the corresponding boundary value. To avoid zero atoms, additionally the value of "S_{pq}" is reduced or increased by 1 \%, respectively.

Marginals of value 1 can arise if all tuples in a sample qualify. In this case we also lower the selectivity slightly (to 0.99) to avoid zero atoms.
