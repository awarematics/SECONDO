[10] An Optimizer-Extension for to Consider Interesting Orders

Jan Engelkamp, December 2005 - February 2006

[toc]

[newpage]

1 Introduction

The original optimizer of the SECONDO DBMS (which can be found in the file ~optimizer.pl~ in the ~Optimizer~-directory of SECONDO) first constructs a so-called predicate order graph (POG) for a given query and then uses the algorithm of dijkstra to find the shortest path through this graph. This shortest path is the base of the (estimated) cheapest plan for the evaluation of the query. The optimizer is described in detail in in R.H. G[ue]ting, T. Behr, V. T. de Almeida, Z. Ding, F. Hoffmann, and M. Spiekermann, Secondo: An Extensible DBMS Architecture and Prototype. Fernuniversit[ae]t Hagen, Informatik-Report 313, March 2004, www.informatik.fernuni-hagen.de/import/pi4/papers/ Secondo04.pdf, page 7 ff.

A modification of that optimizer, that can be found in the file ~modifications.pl~, does not first construct the complete POG and then searches the shortest path through it, but immediately constructs the shortest path and hence prunes away large parts of the POG. (Thus it is more efficient than the original optimizer.) (The modifications are now located in a file called ``immediateplan.pl'', C. D[ue]ntgen.)

In the present file called ~intOrders.pl~ this modification is extended in that way, that the optimizer takes so-called 'interesting orders' into consideration while constructing the shortest path through the (imagined) predicate order graph. The term interesting orders means the orders of base-relations and intermediate results, that possibly allow to choose cheaper (join-) operators to process tuple-streams (and hence to create cheaper cost-edges of the POG), if they are considered, in comparison to the case, where the orders are ignored.

Taking interesting orders into consideration is the prerequisite to notice, if a certain join-implementation can be used, that is very efficient in comparison to other join-implementations: the mergejoin. Hence it can be said, that the aim of the following extension of the SECONDO-optimizer is to translate joins into a mergejoin-operator whenever it is convenient, to consequently construct cheaper plans than the original optimizer in some cases.

To extend respectively change the knowledge-base of the optimizer in that way, that it considers interesting orders, please enter ~intOrders(on)~ after starting ~SecondoPL~ as usual and entering the Prolog-command ~consult('intOrders.pl')~ respectively ~['intOrders.pl']~. Please ensure, that the file ~modifications.pl~ can be found in the ~Optimizer~-directory of the SECONDO-System as well.

~intOrders(off)~ turns all modifications off, so that one can use the original implemented algorithm of the optimizer again.

Further program-modes exist, that can be used to research into the different aspects and effects of considering interesting orders:

  1 After entering ~intOrders(quick)~ for all following queries to evaluate, the interesting orders of base relations and intermediate results are considered in that way, that always the cheapest cost-edge from one node of the POG to its successor is chosen - considering the orders of the incoming tuple-streams, so that the mergejoin can be used if possible. Every time a cost-edge from one node to its successor is chosen as the cheapest one, implicitly a decision is made about the order of its result. In the end it could be, that not the cheapest of all possible paths through the POG is created, because a slight possibility always exist, that a very cheap cost-edge from one node M to its successor N could be created, if the intermediate result belonging to M would be of a certain order, that is different from the order, that it actually has, if on the path from the source-node of the POG to M always the cheapest of all cost-edges has been chosen. The advantage of this program-mode is, that it works very fast and efficient.

  2 After entering ~intOrders(path)~ for all following queries to evaluate, the interesting orders of base relations and intermediate results are considered in that way, that the shortest path to construct does not only base on the nodes of the POG, but on a larger number of nodes. For every single node of the POG multiple 'versions' (twins) are stored and considered, dependent on the plan- respectively cost-edges, that actually lead to them. That is done, because the certain path, that leads to the respective node, determines the order of its result.

  3 After entering ~intOrders(on)~ the interesting orders of base relations and intermediate results are considered in that way, that the shortest path to construct does neither base on the nodes of the POG nor on nodes that represent certain paths, but on the nodes of the POG plus their actual order (to be correct: not the nodes are ordered, but the accompanying intermediate results). That means, that for every single node of the POG multiple 'versions' (twins) are considered, dependent on the plan- respectively cost-edges, that lead to the respective node (and that determine the order of its accompanying intermediate result). But only those node-versions are stored into the set of already created but not yet ticked off nodes, whose intermediate results do have orders, that are new in the sense, that there is not yet a node inside that set, that does have the same POG-number and the same order. If there is such a node already inside that set, the new version is only stored, if the total cost, that is caused on the path from the source-node to the respective node, is lower than the cost stored for the former created node-version.

  4 After entering ~intOrders(test)~ for all following queries to evaluate, the interesting orders of base relations and intermediate results are considered in the same way as after entering ~intOrders(quick)~. But the nodes, that are created and stored, do have the shape of the nodes, that are created after entering ~intOrders(on)~ or ~intOrders(path)~. This program-mode is only interesting for to test this extension of the SECONDO-optimizer.

2 Interesting Orders

2.1 The Idea

The original SECONDO-optimizer does not consider, if a relation is in a certain order or not - neither if a base relation, taken from the database, is ordered nor an intermediate result. But orders can be really interesting for query optimization, because the so-called mergejoin is a very efficient implementation for equi-joins. It causes costs of only "O(n+m)"[1], if one of the two given relations respectively tuple-streams consists of n tupels and the other of m tuples. But it can only be used for relations/tuple-streams, that are ordered (strictly speaken: that are ordered in exactly the same way). Hence for to decide, if a mergejoin instead of some other join-implementation can be used, one has to know, if the involved relations are ordered.

Consequently it is necessary:

  1 to determine, what the orders of the base relations are, that are part of the database (strictly speaken: Which attribute is the one, that determines the primary order of the respective relation. The type of the order - numerically or alphabetically, ascending or decending - is not interesting for the SECONDO-system, because for every data type it is exactly defined, what it means, if a relation is ordered. If a relations order is for example determined by a numerical attribute, it is defined, that the order is numerically ascending. If it would be decending, then for the SECONDO-System the relation is unordered.)

  2 to trace, how the orders are passed on to intermediate results. For intermediate relations, that are the result of a selection or a projection on say a relation A it is easy, to determine its order: its simply the order of the given relation A. But for joins the results order is dependent on the respective join-implementation, that is chosen to process the join.

The mergejoin passes on the order of the two original/given relations respectively tuple-streams, because in principle it is just a step-by-step scan of the two relations and a concatenation of those tupels, that match the join-condition. The loopjoin passes on the order of that one of the two original relations, that is used as the so-called 'outer relation' by the loopjoin-operator. The hashjoin does not pass on any of the orders of the original relations. The sortmergejoin sorts both of the original relations accordant to the join-predicate. Hence the order of its result does not depent on the orders of the given tuple-streams but on the join-predicate.

The sortmergejoin sorts both of the original relations accordant to the join-predicate. But there are cases, where it is not necessary to actually sort both relations, but only one and then use the mergejoin instead of the sortmergejoin. Hence instead of choosing one of the appropriate implementations for a join to process, in such a case two operators are concatenated: a sort-operator on one of the relations/tuple-streams and a mergejoin. In other words: A sort-operator is additionally inserted into the plan and the mergejoin is chosen as the appropriate join-implementation.

This principle (or mechanism) is described in detail in Guy M. Lohman, Grammar-like Functional Rules for Representing Query Optimization Alternatives, Proceedings of ACM-SIGMOD, 1988, p. 18-27. But it is described more general and therefore the term 'glue-operator' is used for operators, that are additionally inserted to ascertain a characteristic of the given relations/tuple-streams - like the sort-operator ascertains a respective order.

2.2 Different Ways of Taking Interesting Orders into Consideration

The algorithm of the modified SECONDO-optimizer is described in ~modifications.pl~, chapter 2.1 'The Idea and Algorithm'. By means of calling ~intOrders(quick)~  this algorithm (to be correct: the program, that realizes this algorithm) is extended with the following phases:

  1 Determine the orders of the base-relations and store them into the PROLOG-interpreters knowledge-base, when the ~argument~-elements are stored.

  2 When a new node is created as the successor of an already existing node, determine the orders of all relevant intermediate results and store this information as the order-information for that new node.

  3 When a new egde has been created, check the possibility of using a mergejoin as the appropriate operator for realizing that edge (and the possibility of using the glue-operator 'sort' plus a mergejoin).

  4 If a mergejoin can be used, determine the order of its result and store it as the order-information for the edges target-node.

  5 Together with all the other possible plan- and cost-edges create a mergejoin-plan- respectively cost-edge as well, if possible (or a plan-/cost-edge, that realizes a glue- plus the mergejoin-operator).

  6 After the cheapest of all cost-edges from one node to its successor has been determined, check, what operator it realizes. If it is a join-operator but no mergejoin (with or without a glue-operator in advance), correct the order-information stored for the successors result. If it is a mergejoin-operator, then the results order has already been determined.

By means of calling ~intOrders(path)~ the algorithm of the modified SECONDO-optimizer (to be correct: the program, that realizes this algorithm) is extended with the following phases:

  1 Determine the orders of the base-relations and store them into the PROLOG-interpreters knowledge-base, when the ~argument~-elements are stored.

  2 When a new node is created as the successor of an already existing node, determine the orders of all relevant intermediate results and store this information as the order-information for that new node.

  3 When a new egde has been created, check the possibility of using a mergejoin as the appropriate operator for realizing that edge (and the possibility of using the glue-operator 'sort' plus a mergejoin).

  4 If a mergejoin can be used, determine the order of its result and store it as the order-information for the edges target-node.

  5 Together with all the other possible plan- and cost-edges create a mergejoin-plan- respectively cost-edge as well, if possible (or a plan-/cost-edge, that realizes a glue- plus the mergejoin-operator).

  6 For every single cost-edge from one node to all its successors insert a separate target-node into the set of already created, but not yet ticked off nodes. Apart from all the information, that constitute a node of the POG, store the order information of the cost-edges result as well.

  7 When selecting the node with the minimal distance to the source-node from among all the nodes, contained in the set of already created, but not yet ticked off nodes, correct all relevant interesting orders of intermediate results, that are currently stored in the PROLOG-interpreters knowledge-base, so that no order, that has been determined after the respective node was put into that set, influences the orders of results, that will be determined in future.

By means of calling ~intOrders(on)~ the algorithm of the modified SECONDO-optimizer (to be correct: the program, that realizes this algorithm) is extended with the following phases:

  1 Determine the orders of the base-relations and store them into the PROLOG-interpreters knowledge-base, when the ~argument~-elements are stored.

  2 When a new node is created as the successor of an already existing node, determine the orders of all relevant intermediate results and store this information as the order-information for that new node.

  3 When a new egde has been created, check the possibility of using a mergejoin as the appropriate operator for realizing that edge (and the possibility of using the glue-operator 'sort' plus a mergejoin).

  4 If a mergejoin can be used, determine the order of its result and store it as the order-information for the edges target-node.

  5 Together with all the other possible plan- and cost-edges create a mergejoin-plan- respectively cost-edge as well, if possible (or a plan-/cost-edge, that realizes a glue- plus the mergejoin-operator).

  6 For every single cost-edge from one node to all its successors insert a separate target-node (together with the order information of the cost-edges result) into the set of already created, but not yet ticked off nodes, if (a) no variant of that target-node is already in that set, thats cost-edges result is of the same order like the node-variant, that shall be inserted, or if (b) a variant of that target-node is already in that set, thats cost-edges result is of the same order like the node-variant, but thats distance- respectively cost-value is higher, than the cost-value of the new node-variant, that shall be inserted. (Please note, in the formulation 'a target-nodes cost-edges result' that cost-edge is meant, that leads from its predecessor to that target-node. 'A target-nodes result' would not be the correct formulation, because the optimizer differs between an edges target-node and an edges result-node. For details please see ~optimizer.pl~, chapter 2 'Data Structures'.)

  7 When selecting the node with the minimal distance to the source-node from among all the nodes, contained in the set of already created, but not yet ticked off nodes, correct all relevant interesting orders of intermediate results, that are currently stored in the PROLOG-interpreters knowledge-base, so that no order, that has been determined after the respective node was put into that set, influences the orders of results, that will be determined in future.

3 Preparation

3.1 Changing Clauses of the Original Optimizer

For to consider interesting orders, it is necessary to modify clauses, that are part of the original optimizer. To avoid, that the original optimizers code (i. e. the file ~optimizer.pl~) must manually be edited, the clauses are modified inside the PROLOG-interpreters knowlege-base.

First the ~partition~-clauses, defined in chapter 3.2 of ~optimizer.pl~, have to be modified. How this is done, is described in detail in the following chapter 4.2 'Interesting Orders of Base-Relations'.

Second the ~copyPart~-clauses, defined in chapter 3.5 of ~optimizer.pl~, are changed. How this is done, is described in detail in the following chapter 4.3.1 'Determining Order Information while Creating Nodes'.

Aditionally new clauses have to be added - clauses, that are needed for the translation of joins (see chapter 5.1 'Translating Joins') and for determining the costs of the respective join-operators (see chapter 5.2 'Costs'). In particular these clauses are:

----
join00(...) => mergejoin(...) :- ...
join00(...) => sortLeftThenMergejoin(...) :- ...
join00(...) => sortRightThenMergejoin(...) :- ...
plan_to_atom(mergejoin(X, Y, A, B), Result) :- ...
plan_to_atom(sortLeftThenMergejoin(X, Y, A, B), Result) :- ...
plan_to_atom(sortRightThenMergejoin(X, Y, A, B), Result) :- ...
cost(mergejoin(X, Y, _, _), Sel, S, C) :- ...
cost(sortLeftThenMergejoin(X, Y, _, _), Sel, S, C) :- ...
cost(sortRightThenMergejoin(X, Y, _, _), Sel, S, C) :- ...
----

One clause is defined, that controls all necessary changes.

3.2 Changing Clauses of ~modifications.pl~

The clauses of ~modifications.pl~, that have to be changed, when intersting orders shall be considered, are the clauses of ~checkSuccessor~ (see ~modifications.pl~, chapter 2.5.6 'Creating Edges to Successors') and ~sweepKnowledgeBase~ (see ~modifications.pl~, chapter 2.4.1 'Sweeping the Knowledge-Base' and chapter 4.1 of this file 'Retracting Formerly Stored Information')

For to consider interesting orders in different ways, different ~checkSuccessor~-clauses are defined. What that means, is described in the following chapter.

3.3 Turning On and Off the Different Program-Modes

To extend respectively change the knowledge-base of the SECONDO-optimizer in that way, that it considers interesting orders, please enter ~intOrders(quick)~, ~intOrders(on)~, ~intOrders(path)~ or ~intOrders(test)~ after starting ~SecondoPL~ as usual and entering the Prolog-command ~consult('intOrders.pl')~ respectively ~['intOrders.pl']~. Please ensure, that the file ~modifications.pl~ can be found in the ~Optimizer~-directory of the SECONDO-System as well.

~intOrders(off)~ turns all modifications off, so one can use the original implemented algorithm of the optimizer again.

After entering ~intOrders(quick)~ for all following queries to evaluate, the interesting orders of base relations and intermediate results are considered in that way, that always the cheapest cost-edge from one node of the POG to its successor is chosen - considering the orders of the incoming tuple-streams, so that the mergejoin can be used if possible. Every time a cost-edge from one node to its successor is chosen as the cheapest one, implicitly a decision is made about the order of its result. In the end it could be, that not the cheapest of all possible paths through the POG is created, because a slight possibility always exist, that a very cheap cost-edge from one node M to its successor N could be created, if the intermediate result belonging to M would be of a certain order, that is different from the order, that it actually has, if on the path from the source-node of the POG to M always the cheapest of all cost-edges has been chosen.

The advantage of this program-mode is, that it is very much faster than the ~intOrders(path)~- and the ~intOrders(on)~-mode.

3.4 Observing, How the Optimizer in Detail Works

There are goals in several clauses of this file existing just for observing, how the modified optimizer in detail works. They are currently commented out. Search und replace the per-cent-symbol directly followed by the grid-symbol with the goal ~o b s e r v e~ and a lot of detailed information about how the optimizer works is printed on your screen while queries are evaluated. Search und replace ~o b s e r v e~ with the per-cent-symbol directly followed by the grid-symbol later to restore the original state of this program.

May 2006, Christian D[ue]ntgen: ~observe/0~ was replaced by ~dm/2~ and ~dc/2~. If you want to switch to the verbose mode, just type

---- setOption(debug), debugLevel(intOrders).
----

at runtime. ~delOption(debug)~ or ~noDebug(intOrders)~ should stop the verbose mode.

Because it is not very helpful, when a lot of output races over your screen, you can change the existing file, so that the run of the optimizer stops after every interesting step - interesting in relation to the consideration of interesting orders. Just search and replace the per-cent-symbol directly followed by the exclamation-mark with the goal ~p a u s e~ and you must press the enter-key of your keyboard a few times while the optimizer evaluates a query. Search und replace ~p a u s e~ with the per-cent-symbol directly followed by the exclamation-mark later to restore the original state of this program.

4.2 Interesting Orders of Base-Relations

At the moment the SECONDO-DBMS does not provide information about the orders of the relations contained in the respective database. Hence the following facts are arbitrary defined and maybe do not represent the actual orders of an existing database.

May 2006, Christian D[ue]ntgen: The file ~storedOrderings.pl~ is now used to import/export information on the ordering of relations. The file is managed from predicates in file ``database.pl''.

Later some file ~storedOrders.pl~ shall automatically be generated by the SECONDO-DBMS (equivalent to the files ~storedCards.pl~, ~storedIndexes.pl~ and ~storedRels.pl~ for example), that contains automatically generated facts of the following shape:

----
storedOrder(Database, Relation, Attribute)
----

At the moment, corresponding to every of the following ~storedRel~-facts a ~storedOrder~-fact has manually be defined.

----
storedRel(staedte, [sname, bev, plz, vorwahl, kennzeichen]).
storedRel(orte, [kennzeichen, ort, vorwahl, bevt]).
storedRel(plz, [plz, ort]).
----

For a better clarity the ~storedOrder~-facts are part of this file. They must be commented out later, if the above mentioned file ~storedOrders.pl~ exists.

----
:- assert(storedOrder(opt, staedte, sName)),
   assert(storedOrder(opt, orte, kennzeichen)),
   assert(storedOrder(opt, plz, ort)).

----

Suggested alternatives for testing the optimizer:

----
storedOrder(opt, staedte, pLZ).
storedOrder(opt, orte, kennzeichen).
storedOrder(opt, plz, pLZ).

storedOrder(opt, staedte, sname).
storedOrder(opt, orte, ort).
storedOrder(opt, plz, ort).
----

The stored orders are used to determine the orders of the arguments, that represent the base relations inside the optimizers knowledge-base. Therefore the ~partition~-clauses, defined in chapter 3.2 of ~optimizer.pl~, must be modified. But instead of editing the file ~optimizer.pl~ manually, the original static procedure ~partition~ is defined as dynamic, the existing clauses are retracted from the knowledge-base and new clauses are asserted.

4.3 Interesting Orders of Intermediate Results

4.3.1 Determining Order Information while Creating Nodes

The ~copyPart~-clauses, defined in chapter 3.5 of ~optimizer.pl~, must be changed. But instead of changing the file ~optimizer.pl~ manually, the original static procedure ~copyPart~ is defined as dynamic, the existing clauses are retracted from the knowledge-base and new clauses are asserted.

The new goals inside the following ~copyPart~-clauses just determine the orders of the arguments of the relevant ~arp~-elements (see chapter 2 of ~optimizer.pl~) and call ~assertintOrderResNo~ to store all information about the arguments, that is later needed to determine the order of the respective result.

4.3.2 Determining the Orders of Intermediate Results

The following clauses ~setResultOrder~ and ~correctResultOrder~ are called in ~checkSuccessor~ (if the program-mode ~intOrders(quick)~ or ~intOrders(test)~ are used, in the other modes these clauses are used in a slightly other way) to first determine, if it is acutally possible to create mergejoin-plan-edges (or sortLeftThenMergejoin- or sortRightThenMergejoin-plan-edges) from a node to its successor (dependent on the arguments orders and the join-attributes), second, what the order of the respective result will be, if the mergejoin-operator (or the sortLeftThenMergejoin- or the sortRightThenMergejoin-operator) will later be chosen as the appropriate join-implementation, and third, what the order of the respective result actually is, after the cheapest cost-edge from the node to its successor is chosen. (The latter again only goes for the program-modes ~intOrders(quick)~ respectively ~intOrders(test)~. In the other program-modes no cheapest cost-edge is determined.)

Actually the order of the result is at first set to that order, that the result will have, if a mergejoin-plan-edge respectively -cost-edge (or a sortLeftThenMergejoin- or sortRightThenMergejoin-plan-edge) will be the cheapest one from the relevant node to its successor. That is done with the call of ~setResultOrder~. Later with the call of ~correctResultOrder~ the results order is corrected, if necessary.

Please note, that ~setResultOrder~ and ~correctResultOrder~ are even called, if a plan-edge realizing the mergejoin-operator is completely irrelevant - because (for example) the respective egde doesn't even represent a join or it does, but the join is no equi-join. In that case the results order has already been ascertained in advance and the calls are caught by clauses, that just return a 'true'.

Because the original version of ~checkSuccessor~ in chapter 2.5.6 'Creating Edges to Successors' of ~modifications.pl~ does not contain the goals ~setResultOrder~ and ~correctResultOrder~, it must be modified. But instead of editing the file ~modifications.pl~ manually, the original static procedure ~checkSuccessor~ is defined as dynamic, the existing clauses are retracted from the knowledge-base and new clauses are asserted.

The ~loopjoin~ passes on the order of that one of the two given relations, that is used as the so-called 'outer relation' by the loopjoin-operator. In SECONDO the order of the result of a loopjoin is the order of the left tuple-stream. Hence if the order of an intermediate result is corrected into the result-order of the loopjoin-operator, the order of the left tuple-stream is stored as the result-order.

The order of the result of a ~sortmergejoin~ is determined by the join-predicate, but it is not relevant, if the left or the right join-attribute is chosen for to determine the results order. Hence if the order of an intermediate result is corrected into the result-order of the sortmergejoin-operator, the left join-attribute is stored as the result-order. (The right join-attribute could be stored as well.) To determine the left join-attribute the join-predicate has to be parsed equivalent to the parsing taking place in ~checkAttrAndPredPart~ (see chapter 4.3.1).

The result of a ~hashjoin~-operator, the carthesian ~product~, the ~symmjoin~ and the ~spatialjoin~ has no intersting order.

5 The Merge-Join and its Variants

5.1 Translating Joins

Some clauses of the original optimizers code contained in the file ~optimizer.pl~ have to be modified, if interesting orders shall be considered. This has already been explained. Further some clauses must be added. One can manually modify that file. In that case it is necessary to first add such clauses into chapter 5.2.3 'Translation of Joins' of ~optimizer.pl~, that translate joins using the mergejoin-operator (respectively the sortLeftThenMergejoin- or sortRightThenMergejoin-operator), and second into chapter 5.1.3 'Converting Plans to Atoms and Writing them', that convert these operators into antoms.

Please note that those changes of the original optimizers code won't affect its processing. The clauses only become relevant, if ~intOrders(X)~ respectively ~intOrders(X, time)~ will be called beforehand and X unifies with ~quick~, ~path~, ~on~ or ~test~.

Another way to add clauses to the PROLOG-interpreters knowledge-base, is to define the relevant hitherto static procedures as dynamic and then assert the clauses into the knowledge-base. This is done in the following.

Please note, that both ways to enhance the optimizers set of clauses are equivalent.

May 2006, Christian D[ue]ntgen: The extensions to plan\_to\_atom/2 have been integrated into file ``optimizer.pl''. Nonsense-text about errors in executable plans containing ~sortby~ has been deleted.


5.2 Costs

To determine all relevant costs, again some clauses must be added to ~optimizer.pl~.

May 2006, Christian D[ue]ntgen: The cost functions for ~mergejoin~, ~sortLeftThenMergejoin~ and ~sortRightThenMergejoin~ have been moved to the file
``optimizer.pl''.

5.3 Deciding, what Join-Implementation can be Used

For to decide, if a join-implementation, that needs ordered tuple-streams, can be used or not, the clause ~orderTest~ is called with the argument, what implementation shall be tested. ~orderTest~ just checks, if an appropriate fact has been stored into the PROLOG-interpreters knowledge-base, and retracts it or fails.

6 Using Other than the POG-Nodes for the Shortest-Path-Construction

Please note, that the program-mode ~intOrders(quick)~ only calls clauses defined in the above chapters and works without those of the following chapters.

6.1 Using new Node-Sets-Implementations

The original SECONDO-optimizer uses the algorithm of dijkstra to search the shortest path through a formerly constructed so-called predicate order graph (POG). Its modification realized in ~modifications.pl~ also uses a variant of this algorithm for the immediate construction of that shortest path. (For details see chapter 2.1 of ~modifications.pl~.)

The following clause changes the implementation of the set for the already reached respectively created but not yet ticked off nodes, that is used by the algorithm of dijkstra, as well as the implementation of the set of already ticked off nodes.

*/

correctStoredNodesShape :-
  intOrdersRNSImplementation,
% moving the following line into predicate 'intOrdersTOSImplementation' results
% in errors.  The reason is still unknown. Also, using 'retractall/1' instead
% of 'retract/1' causes problems (also in the line above):

/*

6.2 A Reached-Nodes-Set-Implementation, that Stores Interesting Orders

A decisive element of the algorithm of dijkstra is a set containing the already created but not yet ticked off nodes (called REACHED-NODES in ~modifications.pl~). Originally the nodes of the predicate order graph (POG) are more or less directly put into that set, thus the shortest path-search respectively -construction bases on those nodes.

In the current context (to be correct: in the program-modes ~intOrders(path)~ and ~intOrders(on)~) more than just the nodes of the POG have to be considered. Hence the implementation of the set REACHED-NODES is changed. It cannot contain the POG-nodes any more, but must contain 'enhanced' nodes. One interesting point should be the enumeration of these nodes: They are just numbered in the order, in which they are created; for every new node, a numerator is incremented. It is not absolutely necessary, to store an unambiguous number for every node, but it was useful in early program-tests. The other enhancement beside the enumeration of the stored nodes is of course the order-information for every result, that belongs to a stored node.

It must be said, that the following implementation of the set REACHED-NODES is not the most efficient of all possible implementations. An implementation equivalent to the one contained in the file ~boundary.pl~ in the ~Optimizer~-directory of the SECONDO-system would be more efficient. But at the moment it is more important to show the principles and ideas of the optimizers modifications and extensions and to describe these in clarity, than to realize the fastest of all thinkable programs.

~getTickedOffNode~ is only used once to get information about the destination-node at the end of the shortest-path-construction. Hence the stored order-information can be ignored, because the here used modification of the algorithm of dijkstra stops as soon as the destination-node is determined for the first time as the node with the minimal distance to the source-node in comparison to all other nodes currently stored in the set of all hitherto created but not yet ticked off nodes - without considering its results order.

7.2 The Procedure

For to test the enhanced optimizer, that considers interesting orders, the test-clauses of chapter 2.6.2 'The Test-Clauses' from ~modifications.pl~ are used plus those of the above defined ones, that do not cause errors. (For every of the clauses ~example14~ to ~example21~ from ~optimizer.pl~ exists an equivalent in ~modifications.pl~.)

Intentionally in majority such clauses are used that were not specially designed for to test the consideration of interesting orders, because it is understood as an important aspect to get an idea, for how many out of a total number of arbitrary chosen queries cheaper plans can be created, if interesting orders are considered. But please note, that the proportion of cases, where cheaper plans can be created, and cases, where it is not possible to find cheaper plans, very likely vary very much dependent on the actual used databases and their actual use, i. e. the respective queries. Additionally it is understood, that it is more likely to find existing errors, if not specially designed test-queries are evaluated but arbitrary chosen ones.

As for the tests described in ~modifications.pl~ it was ensured that all needed selectivities were already available, so it was not necessary, that the optimizer had to call the SECONDO-kernel during the evaluation of a query. (For details see chapter 2.6.1 'The Procedure' of ~modifications.pl~.)

The used computer was a Fujitsu Siemens Amilo L 1300 Notebook with an Intel Celeron M 370 1.5 GHz processor and 512 MB RAM. The operating system was Linux, distribution 9.3 from the SUSE distributor with kernel 2.6.11.4. Furthermore SWI-Prolog 5.0.10 was used.

For to ensure, that every test-clause (and even ~test21~ and ~test25~) can be evaluated, the PROLOG-interpreter respectively the optimizer was started using the command 'SecondoPL -L64M, -G64M, -T64M' instead of just 'SecondoPL'. (What that means is described in detail in ~modifications.pl~.)

All test-clauses are called immediately after the call of ~sweepKnowledgeBase~ to ensure, that the time needed for to evaluate a test-query was not influenced by the complexity of a formerly evaluated query.

The test-clauses are called several times, because (a) different variants of the used database were defined, where the base-relations have different orders, and (b) every program-mode was tested (without ~intOrders(test)~). For to create different variants of the used database, the ~storedOrder~-facts, described in chapter 4.2 'Interesting Orders of Base-Relations', are manipulated as follows. And for to switch between the different program-modes, the commands ~intOrders(quick, time)~, ~intOrders(on, time)~, ~intOrders(path, time)~, and ~intOrders(off, time)~ are called beforehand.

Orders of the base-relations in the first test-phase:

----
storedOrder(staedte, sName).
storedOrder(orte, kennzeichen).
storedOrder(plz, ort).
----

Orders of the base-relations in the second test-phase:

----
storedOrder(staedte, pLZ).
storedOrder(orte, kennzeichen).
storedOrder(plz, pLZ).
----

Orders of the base-relations in the third test-phase:

----
storedOrder(staedte, sname).
storedOrder(orte, ort).
storedOrder(plz, ort).
----

Please note, that the database-variants are defined such, that in the first two test-phases two of the three base-relations are ordered by attributes that correspond in the sense, that they are convenient join-attributes, and in the latter all three base-relations are ordered by attributes that correspond in that sense.

With the results of the test-calls several tables (one for every database-variant) are built, that contain the following columns:

  1 ~nop~ = number of predicates of the test-query

  2 ~functor~ = the functor of the test-clause that leads to the evaluation
of the test-query

  3 ~mode~ = indicating, if ~intOrders(quick)~, ~intOrders(test)~, ~intOrders(path)~, ~intOrders(on)~ or ~intOrders(off)~ was called beforehand

  4 ~ctimes~ = times needed for either constructing the POG and searching the
shortest path through it or constructing the shortest path immediately including the consideration of interesting orders

  5 ~cost~ = the estimated cost of the following plan

  6 ~plan~ = the cheapest plan from the source- to the destination-node, that the respective program-mode found respectively constructed

7.3 The Results

All the results can be found in the file ~intOrdersSurvey.html~, attached to this file.

The most important result is, that the optimizer pretty often actually creates cheaper plans for given queries, if it considers interesting orders in the ways described above, than it does, if it ignores the orders of base-relations and intermediate results. In the first test-phase for 12 out of totally 30 queries cheaper plans are created. In the second test-phase for 5 out of totally 30 queries cheaper plans are created, and in the third again for 12 out of totally 30 queries cheaper plans are created. Often, when the estimated costs differ, they distinctly differ. Two examples are: The original optimizer finds a plan for query No. 20 (~test20~), that causes (estimated) costs of 632,54. But if interesting orders are considered, the cheapest plan, that can be created for the same query, causes (estimated) costs of only 381,449 in the first and 378,084 in the third test-phase. For query No. 30 (~otest10~) the original optimizer finds a plan, that causes (estimated) costs of 2093,11. If interesting orders are considered, the cheapest plan, that can be created for the same query, causes (estimated) costs of only 734,619 in the third test-phase. (For to interprete these numbers, please see chapter 6.2.5 of the SECONDO Programmer's Guide - page 60 if version 2 from october 5, 2004 is used - and chapter 8.1 'The Costs of Terms' of ~optimizer.pl~.)

It is not very surprising, that the program-mode ~intOrders(quick)~ does virtually always create plans faster than the program-modes ~intOrders(on)~ and ~intOrders(path)~, and that ~intOrders(path)~ needs a lot of time for the evaluation of complex queries, because the set of already created but not yet ticked off nodes contains by far a lot more nodes in that program-mode than in the other modes.

For some queries with just a few predicates the program-mode ~intOrders(path)~ works faster than the program-mode ~intOrders(on)~. The reason for this should be, that the number of nodes, that are inserted into the set of already created but not yet ticked off nodes, do not distinctly differ in both program-modes, because there are just a few predicates in the query, but in the program-mode ~intOrders(on)~ it is necessary to call the goal ~alreadyInRNS~ in ~putIntoReachedNodesSetIO~ for every created node.

The reason why ~intOrders(off)~ works faster for some queries with just a few predicates even than ~intOrders(quick)~ should be obvious: The original optimizer avoids the additional work, that has to be done for to consider interesting orders. Additionally as described in chapter 6.2 'A Reached-Nodes-Set-Implementation, that Stores Interesting Orders' ~intOrders(path)~ and ~intOrders(on)~ do not realize the most efficient of all possible implementations for the set of already created, but not yet ticked off nodes.

In theory, there must be cases, where ~intOrders(quick)~ does not find the cheapest of all thinkable plans (see chapter 1 'Introduction'). Only ~intOrders(path)~ and ~intOrders(on)~ guarantee to always find the cheapest of all plans. But somehow surprising is, that for only one of the test-queries (~otest10~) ~intOrders(quick)~ creates another plan than ~intOrders(path)~ and ~intOrders(on)~. Obviously the cases, where ~intOrders(quick)~ does actually not find the cheapest of all thinkable plans, are pretty seldom. (It must be said, that really some work was necessary to find an appropriate test-query, where the resulting plans differ.)

Thus it is probably more interesting for practical uses to always use the faster working program-mode ~intOrders(quick)~, that has the disadvantage, that for some particular queries not the cheapest of all possible plans will be created, than the slower working program-mode ~intOrders(on)~, that guarantees to always create the cheapest of all plans.

The fact, that for the test-query No. 30 (~otest10~) the different program-modes come to different resulting plans should not be over-interpreted: First it must be said, that this query was specially designed for to test the consideration of interesting orders and thus it is somehow odd, because it several times contains virtually identical predicates. Second the plans differ just slightly and cause exactly the same (estimated) costs. Third similar differences between the resulting plans for that query can be caused, if in the clause ~putIntoNodeListIO~ the goal ~Distance "<"[1] FirstDistance~ is replaced by ~Distance "=<"[1] FirstDistance~. In that case, in the first test-phase the call of ~intOrders(on, time), otest10(A,B)~ respectively ~intOrders(path, time), otest10(A,B)~ cause the result:

A = 'Staedte  feed {cities} Staedte  feed {s} Orte  feed {places}

Please note, that the use of the variables ~places~ and ~o~ is exchanged similar to the the use of the variables ~cities~ and ~s~ in the documented program-test.

Last but not least it must be said, that even the modified optimizer, realized in ~modifications.pl~, and the original SECONDO-optimizer, that does not consider interesting orders, cause plans for that test-query, that differ in a similar way. Again the use of the variables ~places~ and ~o~ is exchanged similar to the the use of the variables ~cities~ and ~s~ in the documented program-test. (See the following small output-protocol.)
