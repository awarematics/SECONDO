1 Binary Search Tree

This module offers a binary search tree with an additional operation to get
(and remove) the minimum, to support a simple implementation of a priority
queue. It supports duplicate entries for keys.

1.1 The Interface

----	tree_empty(-Tree).
----

~Tree~ is an empty search tree.

----	tree_insert(+Tree, +Key, +Value, -Tree2)
----

Insertion of the ~Key~, ~Value~ pair into ~Tree~ results in ~Tree2~. Keys must
support the predicates [<], [>], =.

----	tree_delete(+Tree, +Key, +Value, -Tree2)
----

Deletes the ~Key~, ~Value~ pair from ~Tree~, resulting in ~Tree2~. If the pair
is not found in the tree, an error message is given.

----	tree_min(+Tree, -Key, -Value, -Tree2)
----

Returns a ~Key~, ~Value~ pair with minimal key and removes it from ~Tree~,
resulting in ~Tree2~. Fails if the tree is empty.


1.2 Implementation

A tree is represented by a term of the form

----	tree(Key, ValueList, Left, Right)
----

or by the term

----	nil
----

denoting the empty tree.
