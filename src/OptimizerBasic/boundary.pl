1 Interface ~Boundary~

[File ~boundary.pl~]

1.1 The Interface
 
The boundary is represented in a data structure with the following 
operations: 

----	b_empty(-Boundary) :-
----

Creates an empty boundary and returns it.

----	b_isEmpty(+Boundary) :-
----

Checks whether the boundary is empty.


----	b_removemin(+Boundary, -Node, -BoundaryOut) :-
---- 
 
Returns the node ~Node~ with minimal distance from the set ~Boundary~ and
returns also ~BoundaryOut~ where this node is removed.
   
----	b_insert(+Boundary, +Node, -BoundaryOut) :-
----
 
Inserts a node that must not yet be present (i.e., no other node of that
name).
   
----	b_memberByName(+Boundary, +Name, -Node) :-
---- 
 
If a node ~Node~ with name ~Name~ is present, it is returned. 
 
---- 	b_deleteByName(+Boundary, +Name, -BoundaryOut) :-
---- 
 
Returns the boundary, where the node with name ~Name~ is deleted.

*/ 
 
/* 
1.2 Implementation of Boundary 
 
The boundary is represented by two data structures, namely (i) a predicate

----	boundary(Name, node(Name, Distance, Path))
----

and (ii) a binary search tree with (key, value) pairs of the form

----    (Distance, NodeName)
----

The first serves to get efficient access by node name, as needed in the
functions ~memberByName~ and ~deleteByName~. The binary search tree supports to
find efficiently the minimum, and can also be efficiently updated.
