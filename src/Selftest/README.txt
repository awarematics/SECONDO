If results defined in the .examples file are too big, they can be stored as
nested list (in object format as written out by save obj to file) in a file
named by the following convention:

result<No>_<Opname>_<Algebra>

where <Algebra> is the first part of the .example file. Hence
the short version (without suffix Algebra), e.g.

result1_feed_Relation
result3_PLUS_Standard

<No> is the number of the example, <Opname> is the operator name or if it is a
symbol like + the alias Name written in capital letters (like in the spec
file). In the latter case the alias name must be specified in the .examples
file as shown in test.examples
