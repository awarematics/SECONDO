The dblp2secondo Converter

1 What this is
==============

This set of tools converts the dblp XML database
into a set of relations which can be restored
in SECONDO. The dblp database contains a lot of
information about computer scientific documents
(like a BibTex Database).

2 The Files
===========

dblp2secondo.......... main script
DBLPLex.l............. scanner for dblp.xml
DBLPParser.y.......... parser for dblp.xml
DoubleTitle.l......... scanner removing double titles from dblp.xml
Exclusions............ file with words not to use as keywords
FilterHTML.l.......... tool converting html-specials
KeyWordCreator.java... tool extracting keywords from a file
makefile.............. makefile for compiling and building tools
progress.cpp.......... tool for progress display
READ.ME .............. this file

3 Requirements
==============

You need an installed SECONDO system with properly settings of the system
variables (SECONDO_PLATFORM and BERKELEY_DB_DIR).

You can download the newest version of the dblp database from
        http://dblp.uni-trier.de/xml/
You need only the file dblp.xml.

If you work with linux, you have to make the dblp2secondo script
executable :    chmod +x dblp2secondo

4 How to use the script
=======================

To convert the database just enter:
   dblp2secondo  [<dir>dblp.xml]
Without any argument specification, the script uses ./dblp.xml as default.

The execution of the script will take a few minutes.
After that, you will find some new files in the directory of the script.

Move the following files into your $SECONDO_BUILD_DIR/bin directory:
   author authordoc document keyword
The files can be restored via
     restore xxx from xxx;
(Don't forget to open a database before.)

5 Cleanup
=========

To remove all created files in the dblp2secondo directory just enter
   dblp2secondo clean
