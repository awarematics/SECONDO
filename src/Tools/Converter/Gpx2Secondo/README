This tool is a little converter for gpx data. 
Only the track and the name of the track are extracted in the 
current version.

Compiling:

just type in "make"

Using:

java Gpx2Secondo *.gpx >Tracesobj

will convert all gpx files into a single relation.
If there are more than 1000 files to convert (the usual bach cannot handle more than 1000 arguments),
just use a pipe to convert the files:

find -iname "*.gpx" | java Gpx2Secondo > Tracesobj
