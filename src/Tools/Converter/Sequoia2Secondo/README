
Sequoia Data Converter
======================

General Information
-------------------
Point and Polygon files can be downloaded via:

http://s2k-ftp.cs.berkeley.edu:8000/sequoia/benchmark

All provided files are compressed. Use guzip to unpack them.


Converting Point Data
---------------------

Point data can be converted into Secondo's nested list format using the
CVS2Secondo converter. Here, just a appropriate configuration file 
seq-points.cfg is provided. For further information read the documentation
aboud the csv2Secondo converter.



Converting Polygon Data
-----------------------

The converter can process only a single file. If you want to process 
more than a single file, you have to concat them separated by an 
empty line. You can use the following command line (within a bash) to do so:

for i in *; do echo "" >> all; cat $i >> all; done; echo "" >> all

Please substitute the '*' by the filenames which should be concatenated.


The converter is a Java program, before you can use it, it must be 
compiled. This is done by enter 'make' within the converter's directory.

After that, the compiler can be called via:

java SecPoly <filename> [> <outfilename> ]
