[10] Header File of Module PersistentFlobCache

October 2013, Jiamin Lu

1  Overview

The ~ExternalFileCache~ manages the file pointers of external data files
that contain Flob data.
It is mainly prepared for the mode 2 in Flob management.
Tuples and their Flob are kept together in files created by operator like ~fconsume~.
Only tuples are fetched from these files, but leaves their Flob data untouched.
The Flob is read only when they are really needed.

In order to avoid repeatedly open and close the same data file,
this class is built up.
With it, the Flob can get access to the opened file pointer directly.
