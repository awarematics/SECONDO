December 2004, M. Spiekermann. A debug mode for the scanner and parser have been
introduced. The error message will now help much better to locate errors.

September 2006, M. Spiekermann. The Parser and Scanner have been revised in
order to avoid that the generated bison file needs to be modified. The old
version altered the generated code by sed scripts into a C++ class (which was
incompatible with newer bison versions). Now we have still a class NLParser but
it calls the external function ~yyparse~ provided by bison.
