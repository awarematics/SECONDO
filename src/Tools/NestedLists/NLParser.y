[1] Parser of Stable Nested Lists

Copyright (C) 1995 Gral Support Team

December 1995 Holger Schenk

February 2002 Ulrich Telle Port to C++

September 26, 2002 RHG Grammar rewritten to be left-recursive so that the parser
stack depth remains bounded for lists of arbitrary length.

December 6, 2002 M. Spiekermann Construction of the list revised. Usage of a stack data
structure avoids to create nodes which were only used in the construction process.

Dec 2004, M. Spiekermann. Macro YYERROR\_VERBOSE defined.

Sept 2006, M. Spiekermann. Code of the classes NLScanner and NLParser was
revised. Refer to NLParser.cpp.
