It's only a short instruction to start with SecondoPostGIS. You get here no information over the function. You will show it here, if implementation is finished.
<br>
<h2>Start</h2>
At the first start SecondPostGIS asked you, to enter the connection parameters for both databases. This question only come back, if SecondoPostGIS can't find the “.hjort.cfg”.
<br>
<br>
The connection parameters to the databases can edit in the “.hjort.cfg” file. You can find this file in your home directory in folder “.Hjort”. For Example /home/username/.Hjort/.hjort.cfg
