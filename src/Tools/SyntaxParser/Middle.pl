2 Executable Language Operator Syntax


----	secondoOp(?Op, ?Syntax, ?NoArgs) :-
----

~Op~ is a Secondo operator written in ~Syntax~, with ~NoArgs~ arguments.
Currently implemented:

  * postfix, N arguments: corresponds to \_ \# and \_ \_ \#, ...

  * postfixbrackets, N:  $N \geq 1$ arments before the functor, the rest following it
      within squared brackets, separated by commas:
        \_ \# [ \_ ], \_ \# [ \_ , \_ ], \_ \# [ \_ , \_ , \_ ] ...

  * prefix, N: $N \geq 0$ arguments following the functor in round parantheses,
      separated by commas:: \# (\_, \_)

  * infix, 2 arguments: \_ \# \_

  * special, N: all operators requiring a special ~plan\_to\_atom~ rule.

There are deprecated standard translations for operators, which should not be used anymore.
Define an explicit ~secondoOP~ fact instead!

  * binary operators: \_ \# \_  infix

  * N-ary operators, $N \neq 2$:  \# ( \_, \_, \_, ... ) prefix
