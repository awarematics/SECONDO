===========================

This tool can be used for installing new Secondo modules.
In the current version, only algebras are supported. Future
versions may also install new viewers, display classes of the 
HoeseViewer, optimizer extensions and new kernel files.

A secondo module is a zip file with following contents:
  - Source files, including spec file, example file, and makefile
  - an xml file named SecondoExtension.xml, an example can be found in this 
    directory.

Subdirectories are not supported, thus all files must be located in 
the main directory. 
The tool can be compiled by typing 'make'.
After that, the tool can be used by the following command:
  secinstall module_1.zip ... module_n.zip

It will install all modules given as argument.
