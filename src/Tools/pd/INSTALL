1. You need the gcc, flex 2.5.4a and bison 1.3x. Just run

make
make prefix=<install-dir> install

to install the software into <install-dir>.

2. Set some environment variables: 

PD_HEADER  -> the current location of pd.header

e.g. with csh or tcsh use
 
  setenv PD_HEADER /home/user/PD/pd.header

with bash use

  export PD_HEADER=/home/user/PD/pd.header

PD_PS_VIEWER     -> your favorite application which previews Postscript
PD_DVI_VIEWER    -> your TeX-Installation dependent preview tool.

3. Append the path to your installation of the PD-system to your PATH
environment variable in a file which is executed during startup of
a new shell (e.g. .bashrc).

4. Make sure that the location of LaTeX-related commands latex, dvips
and dvips is specified in your PATH variable.


USAGE
-----

There are several shell-scripts translating a pd-file into specific
output formats.

pd2ascii  -> creates an ASCII file. 
pd2tex    -> produces only a LaTeX file.
pd2dvi    -> creates a DVI file.
pd2ps     -> produces a postscript file.
pd2pdf    -> creates a PDF file.
pd2html   -> generates HTML.

pdshow    -> creates a Postscript file using dvips and opens the PS-Viewer.
pdview    -> creates a dvi file and opens the DVI-Viewer.


The enumerate programs reads from stdin and  writes a pd-file with correct
enumeration to stdout. this can be used to correct enumeration automatically.

enumerate < pd-file > new-pd-file
