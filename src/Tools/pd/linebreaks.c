7.2 Program ~linebreaks.c~

This program reads a file from standard input and writes it to standard output. Whenever lines longer than LINELENGTH (which is 80 characters) occur, it puts a line break to the position of the last blank read before character 80 and continues in a new line. If there was no blank in such a line, it introduces a line break anyway (possibly in the middle of a word).
