1.6 Class "Algebra"[1]

An instance of class ~Algebra~ provides access to all information about a given
algebra at run time, i.e. a set of type constructors and a set of operators.
These properties have to be set once. A straightforward approach is to do
these settings within an algebra's constructor. As all algebra modules use
different type constructors and operators, all algebra constructors are
different from each other. Hence we cannot use a single constructor, but
request algebra implementors to derive a new subclass of class ~Algebra~ for
each algebra module in order to provide a new constructor. Each of these
subclasses will be instantiated exactly once. An algebra subclass
instance serves as a handle for accessing an algebra's type constructors
and operators.
