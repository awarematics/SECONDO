September 1996 Claudia Freundorfer

9/26/96 RHG Slight revisions of text. Constant ~MAXTYPES~ introduced.

October 1996 RHG Revised Overview. Introduced types ~SelectMapping~,
~SelectArray~, and variable ~SelectFunction~ to accomodate new concept
for overloading.

December 20, 1996 RHG Changed format of procedure type ~OutObject~.

January 8/9, 1997 RHG Changed format of procedure type ~InObject~.

May 4, 1998 RHG Type ~ValueMapping~ (interface of evaluation functions)
changed; additional parameter ~opTreeNode~ of type ~Supplier~.

May 15, 1998 RHG Added some generic functions for models (~InModel~,
~OutModel~, ~ValueToModel~.

August 25, 1998 Stefan Dieker Added generic functions for type checking
and procedure ~InitKinds~.

April 2002 Ulrich Telle Port to C++, complete revision

August 2002 Ulrich Telle Changed ~PersistValue~ and ~PersistModel~ interface
using nested lists for the type instead of the string representation.

January, 2003 VTA Changed ~PersistValue~ interface and created three
new functions ~Open~, ~Save~, ~Close~, and ~Clone~ that join the ~Create~
and ~Delete~ to form the object state diagram in the Figure 1.

Figure 1: Object state diagram [objstatediagram.eps]

March 2003, Victor Almeida created the function ~SizeOf~

August 2003 VTA Added the ~SaveToList~ and ~RestoreFromList~ functions

September 2003 Frank Hoffmann Added ~ListAlgebras~ and ~GetAlgebraId~

August 2004, M. Spiekermann. Getting an algebra name by its ID is now supported
with the function ~GetAlgebraName~

July 2005, M. Spiekermann. Ugly idention corrected. Missing return statement in
function ExecuteCost corrected.

December 2005, Victor Almeida deleted the deprecated algebra levels
(~executable~, ~descriptive~, and ~hibrid~). Only the executable
level remains. Models are also removed from type constructors.

January 2006, M. Spiekermann. Some declarations were moved to Algebra.h

April 2006, M. Spiekermann. Some declarations were moved to AlgebraInit.h

March 2009, M. Spiekermann. Started to do some clean up. The interface seems to be
overcrowded by functions getting algebra id and type id or operator id. In order to
make the interface simpler to understand and use and easier to maintain
I started to push some functionality into the interfaces TypeConstructor.h
and Operator.h. The new functions ~GetTC~ and ~GetOP~ should be able to replace
many of the other functions, since most of the other functions simply get pointers
of operators and type constructors and call spcific member functions. Moreover they
are not often used in other source files. To be continued ...


1.1 Overview

The "Secondo"[3] algebra manager is responsible for registering and initializing
all specified algebra modules and provides interface functions for the
query processor and the catalog functions to access the type constructors
and operators of each registered algebra module.

The "Secondo"[3] system needs to know about the algebra modules available
at run time. Therefore the developer has to specify which algebra modules
are to be included in the build of the system. The list of all available
algebra modules is kept in the source file "AlgebraList.i"[4]. Each algebra
can be flagged whether it should be included or not.

Currently the list of algebras to be included must be available at link
time, although an algebra module may be a shared library which is loaded
dynamically into memory only when the "Secondo"[3] server is started. To
build an algebra modula as a shared library has the advantage that one
does not need to rebuild the "Secondo"[3] system when only the
implementation of the algebra modula changes.

In principal it would be possible to load algebra modules at runtime which
are not known at link time. But there are at least two disadvantages:

  1 it would restrict the user to command specifications in nested list form,
because the code of the "Secondo"[3] parser depends on algebra specifications,
which are compiled into the code, and

  2 it could cause problems when such a dynamically loadable algebra module is
referenced by any persistent object, but is not included in the load list any
more.

Therefore this feature is currently not implemented.

The ~AlgebraManager~ manages a set of algebra modules. Every algebra
consists of a set of types (type constructors, to be precise) and a set
of operators and is defined by descriptions in SOS-Format as described
in [G[ue]92]. A data structure and optionally a ``data model'' belongs
to each type of the algebra. A ~model~ is a miniature version of the
data structure itself used instead of this for cost estimations (e.g.
for a relation the number of tuples, the number of used segments,
statistics for the distribution of chosen attributes could be taken into
account within the model).

An algebra module offers for each type constructor up to eight generic
operations:

  * ~AssociateKind~, ~Property~. Supply the kind and the properties of a type.

  * ~Create~, ~Delete~. Allocate/deallocate internal memory. Not needed
for types represented in a single word of storage.

  * ~Open~, ~Close~, ~Save~. Only needed, if the type is ~independently~
persistent. For example, they will be needed for relations or object
classes, but not for tuples or atomic values (if we decide that the
latter are not independently persistent).

  * ~Clone~. Clones an instance of a type constructor.

  * ~In~, ~Out~. Map a nested list into a value of the type and vice
versa. Used for delivering a value to the application (among other
things).

  * ~RestoreFromList~, ~SaveToList~. Act as ~In~ and ~Out~ functions
but use internal representation of the objects. Most simple objects
does not need this functions, so by default they will call the
correspondent ~In~ and ~Out~ functions.

  * ~SizeOf~. Returns the size of the RootRecord of the object.

Every value of every type has a representation as a single "Word"[4] of
storage. For a simple type, this can be all. For more complex types, it
may be a pointer to some structure. For persistent objects (that are
currently not in memory) it can be an index into a catalog which tells
where the object is on disk.

Two default implementations (~DefaultOpen~ and ~DefaultSave~)
are supplied which store values in their nested list representation.

The algebra module offers three (sets of) functions for every operator,
namely

  * ~Set of Evaluation Functions~. Associated with each operator is at
least one, but are possibly several, evaluation functions. Each
evaluation function maps a list of input values given in an array of
~Word~ into a result value (also a ~Word~). The interface of the procedure
is independent from the type of operation. Stream operators and
parameter function calls are handled by calling the functions ~Request~,
~Open~, ~Close~, ~Cancel~, and ~Received~ of the module ~QueryProcessor~.

  * ~Type Mapping~. This function maps a list of input types in nested
list format (~ListExpr~) into an output type. Used for type checking and
mapping.

  * ~Selection Function~. This function is given a list of argument types
together with an operator number; based on these it returns the number
of an evaluation function. This is used to determine for an overloaded
operator the appropriate evaluation function. Usually the same function
can be used for all operators of an algebra; if operators are not
overloaded, identity (on the numbers) is sufficient.
