1 Header File: Algebra Types

May 2002 Ulrich Telle

December 2005, Victor Almeida deleted the deprecated algebra levels
(~executable~, ~descriptive~, and ~hibrid~). Only the executable
level remains. Models are also removed from type constructors.

1.1 Overview

This module defines several types which are important not only to algebra
modules but also throughout the whole "Secondo"[3] system.

constructor must be added to the list of constructors.

Are constants for stream processing.

Operators which have a parameter function with streams as arguments need to
recognize more different messages. For this purpose we will encode the argument
number in the second byte of the integer, in general:

(argNr * FUNMSG) + <message>

Hence if the first argument of a parameter function is a stream we
will use FUNMSG+OPEN (for OPEN), FUNMSG+RQUEST (for REQUEST) etc.
