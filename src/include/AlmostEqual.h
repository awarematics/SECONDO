1 Header File: AlmostEqual

This file defines several different methods to test float values on whether they
are semantically equal and selects the standard method for more complex ones
(as for Points, Units, etc.).

The implementation and the standard tolerance factors are located in
file ``../Tools/Utilities/AlmostEqual.cpp''.
