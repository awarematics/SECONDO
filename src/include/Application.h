1 Header File: Application Management

1.1 Overview

The module ~Application~ provides support for managing an application process.
Access to the name of the executable and the command line parameters is offered
in a portable way.

When used together with the module ~Processes~ a very simple process communication
based on a signal mechanism is available. Currently two user defined signals and
a termination signal are supported. The user signals are flagged in member
variables of the application and can be queried and reset at any time. For
handling a termination signal two different ways are offered:

First, simple flagging is possible and the flag can be queried at any time in the
event loop of the application. The flag should be checked regularly and appropriate
action should be taken when it is set.

Second, the application could provide overwrite the empty virtual method
~AbortOnSignal~. In this method any application specific clean up could take
place. If the method returns to the calling signal handler the application
is exited with a return code of *-999*.

Additionally a communication socket can be passed from a parent process to its
child processes in an operating system independent manner.

Usually the application developer derives his own class from the ~Application~
base class. Only one instance of an application is allowed. The instantiation
of the application should be the very first task in the main program,
since the signal mechanism is activated in the constructor and could miss
signals when not created immediately after start up of the application.

1.2 Interface Methods

This module offers the following routines:

[23]	Creation/Removal   & Information retrieval & Process Communication \\
	[--------]
	Application        & GetArgCount        & GetParent     \\
	[tilde]Application & GetArgValues       & HasSocket     \\
                           & GetApplicationName & GetSocket     \\
                           & GetApplicationPath & ShouldAbort   \\
                           & Instance           & GetUser1Flag  \\
                           & GetOwnProcessId    & GetUser2Flag  \\
                           &                    & ResetUser1Flag  \\
                           & Sleep              & ResetUser2Flag  \\
