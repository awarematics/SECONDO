1 Base64, a class for encoding binary data to text and vice versa.

December 08, M. Spiekermann: Initial Version

This class provides member functions used for encoding and decoding the ~base64~
data format as specified in RFC 1341. The interface was designed to interact
kindly with the text atoms of nested lists. The nested list parser recognizes a
file name enclosed in the tag-pair "<file>"[1],"</file--->" and translates it to
a text atom containing the data of the file encoded into base64 format. The
base64 data maps 24 bits of input to 4 letters into an alphabet of 64
characters. Thus the encoded data grows to 4/3 (not exactly, since newlines are
added every 72 bytes) of the original size and the decoded Size shrinks to less
than 3/4 since newlines and unknown characters are ignored.
