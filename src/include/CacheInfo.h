1.1 Overview

The class ~CacheInfo~ provides cache statistics which are retrieved by the 
function ~GetCacheStatistics~ of class ~SmiEnvironment~. Statistics are
provided by following function of the Berkeley-DB API 

----
    int
    DbEnv::memp_stat(DB_MPOOL_STAT **gsp,
        DB_MPOOL_FSTAT *(*fsp)[], u_int32_t flags);
