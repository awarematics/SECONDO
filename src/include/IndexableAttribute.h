2 Class ~IndexableAttribute~

This class is intended to be used for data types that need to be indexed by B-Trees.
The standard types such as ~int~, ~string~, and ~real~ are directly supported. For
the other (more complex) data types, they need to be converted to a string 
(char pointer) and then indexed. The string representation of the objects should 
preserve the ordering. These data types must also belong to the kind ~INDEXABLE~. 
For an example, see the ~DateTime~ algebra.
