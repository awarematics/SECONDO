[1] JVMInitializer

\begin{center}
   Last Change: May 2004
\end{center}

Algebras written in Java use JNI to call the
Java methods from C/C++. To realize that it is
needed to provide a Java Virtual Maschine
(JVM for short). All Code has to use the same
JVM. It is not possible to use several instances
of the JVM in a single program. Each code which
want to use JNI has to create a JVMInitializer.
The first call of the constructor creates the Java
environment. The file JNI.ini is readed for
initialization of the JVM. After this, the constructor
will make nothing when it called.
