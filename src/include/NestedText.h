2 The Module NestedText

2.1 Definition Part

(File ~PDNestedText.h~)

This module allows one to create nested text structures and to write them to
standard output. It provides in principle a data type ~listexpr~ (representing
such structures) and operations:

[2]	atom: string [x] int [->] listexpr		\\
	atomc: string [->] listexpr			\\
	concat: listexpr [x] listexpr [->] listexpr	\\
	print: listexpr [->] e				\\
	copyout: listexpr [->] string [x] int		\\
	release-storage					\\

However, for use by ~lex~ and ~yacc~ generated lexical analysers and parsers
which only allow to associate integer values with grammar symbols, we represent
a ~listexpr~ by an integer (which is, in fact, an index into an array for
nodes). Hence we have a signature:

[2]	atom: string [x] int [->] int			\\
	atomc: string [->] int				\\
	concat: int [x] int [->] int			\\
	print: int [->] e				\\
	copyout: int [->] string [x] int		\\
	release-storage					\\

The module uses two storage areas. The first is a buffer for text characters,
it can take up to STRINGMAX characters, currently set to 30000. The second
provides nodes for the nested list structure; currently up to NODESMAX = 30000
nodes can be created.

The operations are defined as follows:

----	int atom(string, length) 
	char *string; 
	int length;
----

List expressions, that is, values of type ~listexpr~ are either atoms or lists.
The function ~atom~ creates from a character string ~string~ of length ~length~
a list expression which is an atom containing this string. Possible errors: The
text buffer or storage space for nodes may overflow.

----	int atomc(string) 
	char *string;
----

The function ~atomc~ works like ~atom~ except that the parameter should be a
null-terminated string. It determines the length itself. To be used in
particular for string constants written directly into the function call.

----	int concat(list1, list2) 
	int list1, list2;
----

Concats the two lists; returns a list expression representing the concatenation.
Possible error: the storage space for nodes may be exceeded.

----	print(list)
	int list;
----

Writes the character strings from all atoms in ~list~ in the right order to
standard output. 

----	copyout(list, target, lengthlimit)
	int list;
	char *target;
	int lengthlimit;
----

Copies the character strings from all atoms in ~list~ in the right order into a
string variable ~target~. Parameter ~lengthlimit~ ensures that the maximal
available space in ~target~ is respected; an error occurs if the list expression
~list~ contains too many characters.

----	release_storage()
----

Destroys the contents of the text and node buffers. Should be used only when a
complete piece of text has been recognized and written to the output. Warning:
Must not be used after pieces of text have been recognized for which the parser
depends on reading a look-ahead token! This token will be in the text and node
buffers already and be lost. Currently this applies to lists.
