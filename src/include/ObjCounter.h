[11] Headerfile "ObjCounter.h"[4]

January-February 2008, Mirko Dibbert

1 Overview

This headerfile contains the "ObjCntr"[4] class, which could be used as base class for all classes, that should be equipped with a counter for open objects, which is useful for debugging purposes to locate memory leaks in dynamic data structures. The counter will be automatically in-/decreased on object construction/destruction.

Since each counter needs a unique id, it is recommended to define a unique constant for this purpose in this file to avoid undesignedly multiple use of the same counter.

The counter must be enabled by defining

---- #define ENABLE_OBJECT_COUNT
----
before including this file. If not defined, the "openObjects"[4] method will allways return 0 and no counter variable will be defined.
\newpage

Usage:

---- class MyClass : public ObjCounter<id>;
----
equippes class "MyClass"[4] with an object counter, wich could be accessed by

---- ObjCounter<id>::openObjects()
----
An example can be found in the general tree algebra framework (file "GTAF.h"[4]).
