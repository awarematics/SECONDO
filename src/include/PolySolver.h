[1] PolySolver - Methods to Solve Polynomic Equations

The methods of this file used to be part of the ~TemporalLiftedAlgebra.cpp~.
They have been moved to this file, as the methods may be useful even
outside this algebra.

There were two mayor errors, that have been corrected by Christian D[ue]ntgen
in December 2006. Arguments were changed to be ~const~ and ~references~
whereever practicable.

2. Methods to Solve Polynomic Equations

The Following methods implement algebraic algorithms to solve equations
of the form $a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_1 x^1 + a_0 = 0$, for
$1 \leq n \leq 4$. There is no general solution for polynomials with degree
$n>4$.

2.1 Method ~SolvePoly~ 1

Solves the Polynom ax+b=0 and gives back the number of solutiones.

/*
2.2 Method ~SolvePoly~ 2

Solves the Polynom ax\^2+bx+c=0 and gives back the number of solutiones.
The solutions are given back in ordered style if sort is true.

2.3 Method ~SolvePoly~ 3

Solves the Polynom ax\^3+bx\^2+cx+d=0 and gives back the number
of solutiones. The solutions are given back ordered style.

2.4 Method ~SolvePoly~ 4

Solves the Polynom ax\^4+bx\^3+cx\^2+dx+e=0 and gives back the number of
solutiones. The solutions are given back in an ordered style.
