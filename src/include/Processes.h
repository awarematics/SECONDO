1 Header File: Process Management

April 2002 Ulrich Telle

1.1 Overview

The module ~Processes~ provides support for creating and managing child
processes in an operating system independent manner. Processes are created
using a process factory which is capable of managing a collection of a
user specified number of processes. After spawning child processes the
parent process can interact with the child process by a signal mechanism.
Currently two user signals and a termination signal are supported for
child processes which use the ~Application~ class for implementing the
signal mechanism. The parent process may wait for completion of one or
all of his child processes. After termination of a child process its exit
code can be accessed. After inspecting the exit code of child process
its entry in the process collection may be reused by the process factory.
On startup of the process factory the application may allow to reuse
entries of terminated processes which exit code was not inspected.

Additionally support for passing a communication socket to a child process
is provided. This is useful when a server process listens on a port for
client connections (through the method ~Accept~ of the socket module) and
spawns a child process for servicing each client.

The process factory takes care of any necessary clean up actions after
termination of a child process, especially when client sockets for network
communication are involved.

1.2 Interface Methods

This module consists of two classes: the ~Process~ class and the ~ProcessFactory~
class. Usually the ~Process~ class should not be used directly by an application.
The class ~ProcessFactory~ offers the following routines:

[23]	Process factory & Process handling  & Process information \\
	[--------]
        StartUp         & SpawnProcess      & IsProcessOk         \\
        ShutDown        & WaitForProcess    & IsProcessTerminated \\
        GetInstance     & WaitForAll        & GetExitCode         \\
                        & SignalProcess     & GetRealProcessId    \\
                        & SignalRealProcess & SetDirectory        \\
                        & Sleep             &                     \\
