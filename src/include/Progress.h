Class ~ProgressWrapper~

Class ~LocalInfo~

This class inherits from class ~ProgressLocalinfo~ and has an additional
pointer to some class ~T~.

In operator implementations you may define the local.addr pointer
like this:

----  local.addr = new LocalInfo<SortByLocalInfo>;
----

Moreover, the ~SortByLocalInfo~ class must inherit from class ~ProgressWrapper~

----  SortByLocalInfo : protected ProgressWrapper { ... }
----

Refer to the ~sortby~ operator for implementation details.
