1 Header File: Query Processor

September 1996 Claudia Freundorfer

December 23, 1996 RHG Changed procedure  ~construct~ to include checks for
correctness of query and evaluability of the operator tree.

January 3, 1997 RHG Added parameter ~defined~ to procedures ~construct~ and
~annotateX~ to allow checking whether all objects have defined values.

May 4, 1998 RHG Added procedure ~resultStorage~.

May 4, 1998 RHG Added procedure ~getSupplier~.

May 15, 1998 RHG Added procedures ~evalModel~ and ~requestModel~.

June 18, 1998 RHG Added procedures ~getNoSons~ and ~getType~.

January 24, 2001 RHG Change of procedure ~Destroy~ taken from SecondoReference.

January 26, 2001 RHG Added an ~isFunction~ parameter to procedure ~construct~.

May 2002 Ulrich Telle Port to C++, integrated descriptive algebra level
and function mapping.

February 3, 2003 RHG Added QP\_COUNTER and QP\_COUNTERDEF.

August 2004, M. Spiekermann. Private method ~TestOverloadedOperators~ introduced.
This function checks a list of operators if they can map a given input type to 
some other type. The first operator returning not result type "typeerror" will
be used. Moreover, the input and outputs of the type mapping functions can be traced
and if all type mappings fail all possible operators together with their algebra names
are reported.

May 2005, M. Spiekermann. New member variable ~maxmemPerOperator~ inttroduced. This
variable will be set by the SecondoInterface at startup. The value can be defined in
the configuration file. In the future it may be nice if the Query Processor computes
this value based on a global memory limit per query. 

June 2005, M. Spiekermann. ~SetDeleteFunction~ added.

December 2005, Victor Almeida deleted the deprecated algebra levels
(~executable~, ~descriptive~, and ~hibrid~). Only the executable
level remains. Models are also removed from type constructors.

January 2006 Victor Almeida created the FLOB cache.

January - March 2006, M. Spiekermann. Changes for supporting ~streams~ as
arguments to parameter functions. 


1.1 Overview

This module describes the interface of module ~QueryProcessor~.
The modules offers all the basic operations for executing an executable
command in nested list format. The module ~QueryProcessor~ offers a data
structure to store an operator tree, procedures to build an operator tree
from an access plan given by the optimizer and procedures to execute it by
quasi-coroutines. 

The task of the query processor is to evaluate queries given as nested
list expressions. It divides the task into three steps:

  1 The given query is ~annotated~ which means all the symbols occurring
in the query are analyzed (e.g. objects or operators are looked up in
the system catalog) and the found information is attached to the symbol.
The result is an ~annotated query~, again a nested list. This is done by
method ~Annotate~. 

    This step includes calling ~type mapping functions~ for each
operator of the query. The type mapping function gets a list of argument
types (associated with the arguments of the operator in the query). It
then checks whether argument types are correct. If so, it returns a
result type, otherwise a special symbol ~typeerror~. The result type is
used to annotate the operator application in the query. 

    This step also includes calling a ~selection function~ which maps
an operator into an evaluation procedure. This is used for overloaded
operators, for example + (with four evaluation functions for the
possible combinations of int and real arguments). All operators have
such a selection function, even if they are not overloaded; in that case
the selection function is simple (e.g. identity for the operator number
to function number mapping) and it may be the same for all operators of
an algebra. 

  2 An annotated query is taken and transformed into an ~operator tree~.
Method ~Subtree~ constructs the tree from the annotated query.

  3 Finally, an evaluation method called ~Eval~ traverses the tree,
calling ~evaluation functions~ for the operators there. The evaluation
functions can call (their) parameter functions through special interface
procedures to the query processor. They can also produce or consume
streams in cooperation with the query processor (that is, ~Eval~). 

1.3 Interface methods

The class ~QueryProcessor~ provides the following methods:

result type of the expression in ~resultType~. If there is a type error, 
~correct~ is set to "false"[4] and ~resultType~ contains a symbol 
~typeerror~. 

If there is an  object with undefined value mentioned in the query, then
~defined~ is "false"[4].

Even if there is no type error, a query may not be evaluable, for example,
if the outermost operator produces a stream, or the query is just an
argument list. The query processor may also view the query as an argument
list, if the root operator is not recognized (an error in the query).
Therefore, ~construct~ returns in ~evaluable~, whether the constructed
tree can indeed be evaluated.

Finally, it is returned in ~isFunction~ whether the tree represents an
abstraction. In this case, it is not evaluable, but we may want to store
the function in a database object.
