The class ~RTuple~ (Referenced Tuple) manages the calls needed to do a correct
handling of reference counting. This is helpful for complex operator
implementations, which need to manage many pointers of class ~Tuple~ and which
need to keep their values during two REQUEST messages, e.g. refer to the
implementation of ~mergejoin~ for its usage.
