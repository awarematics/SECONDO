1.1 Overview

The compilation of "Secondo"[3] has to take into account differences
in the architecture of the underlying operating system. Usually the
compiler defines symbols which can be used to identify the operating system
"Secondo"[3] is built for.

Depending on the actual operating system several constants and system
dependent macros are defined.

/*
When creating or using shared libraries (i.e. DLLs = Dynamic Link Libraries)
on Windows platforms it is necessary to specify for C++ classes whether they
are imported from a DLL (when using a DLL) or exported from a DLL (when
creating a DLL).

Since the "Secondo"[3] system has separate components, namely the database kernel
and the storage management interface one must be able to differentiate between
these components.

Currently there are two components:

  * SDB  -- the "Secondo"[3] DataBase kernel.
Define SDB\_USE\_DLL if compiling modules which want to use a DLL for this component.
Define SDB\_CREATE\_DLL if compiling this component as a DLL.

  * SMI  -- the Storage Management Interface.
Define SMI\_USE\_DLL if compiling modules which want to use a DLL for this component.
Define SMI\_CREATE\_DLL if compiling this component as a DLL.

If none of these symbols is defined it is assumed that a static library is to be built.

*NOTE*: The GNU C++ compiler does not require these symbols to be present in
class definitions since all exportable symbols of a DLL are exported by default.
But to be compatible with compilers like Microsoft Visual C++ they should be
used.

/*
February 2006. M. Spiekermann

I observed a strange error using SuSe-Linux 9.2, gcc 3.4.6. Under this
environment failed assertions cause an "SIGSEGV"[4] error. Trying to detect the
problem with valgrind turns out that "assert(fail)" (the function which will be
called to report failed assertions, refer to "assert.h") reads data from invalid
addresses (Adress "0xxxxxxxx" is not stacked, allocated or freed).
   
Hence it must be a bug which is not caused by illegal usage of pointers created
by malloc or free but rather an array index which is out of range such that
write operations corrupt data or program code. These kinds of bugs are hard to
localize. 

Before initialization of SecondoInterface "assert(fail)" works, but afterwards it
crashes.  Since the parsing of example files makes frequent use of text atoms
it could be an uncovered bug in the nested list representation of text atoms.
But for the moment that is only a guess.  For two times I  could create code on
different places which raised a "SIGSEGV" when processing "assert(fail)", e.g.:

----
  assert(true);
  cerr << "some string" << endl;
  assert(false); // the call of __assert_fail causes a SIGSEGV
----

But if in the first line true is changed to false, the call of "assert(fail)"
works correctly.
  
One time this could be constructed somwhere in "Smi::Startup" and another time
after some other code was probably changed, it could be observed in class
ExampleReader. However, depending on the code the position where "assert(false)"
turns from correct a correct abort into "SIGSEGV" crash changes :-(
  
As a work around you may activate the redefinition of assert as given below.
This "does not fix the bug" but avoids the misguiding report of a "SIGSEGV"
instead of a failed assertion.
