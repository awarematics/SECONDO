1 Header File: Secondo Interface

September 1995 Claudia Freundorfer

January 2, 1997 Ralf Hartmut G[ue]ting. Explanation of commands and
introduction of error codes.

January 10, 1997 RHG Additional error codes for error lists. Made
variable ~Errors~ available as well as procedure ~NumericTypeExpr~.

January 17, 1998 RHG Changes in description, new error code 9.

May 15, 1998 RHG Added a command ~model value-expression~ which is
analogous to ~query value-expression~ but computes the result model for
a given query rather than the result value.

May 2002 Ulrich Telle Port to C++, added initialization and termination
methods for hiding the details of setting up the "Secondo"[3] environment
from the user interface program.

December 2002 M. Spiekermann an application specific nested list memory (al) was
introduced. Every Interface method which returns a nested list copies the
list from the nl Object into the al Object. If a list is input for some Interface
methods e.g. NumTypeExpr(...) the list is copied from al to nl. Now the core systems
own list memory is refreshed in the Interface method Secondo(...) so that every
command is processed with an initially empty list container.
The application has to take care about its own list memory to avoid infinte growing.

April 29 2003 Hoffmann Added save and restore commands for single objects.

May 2004, M. Spiekermann. Support for derived objects added.

August 2004, M. Spiekermann. All error codes of the interface are now represented
by constants. The mapping between codes and error messages is also implemented in
the header file to facalitate maintenance. Moreover, new private methods for some
Secondo commands have been declared to reduce the complex nesting in the
implementation of the ~Secondo~ function.

September 2004, M. Spiekermann. A bug in the error handling of restore database has been fixed.
Error code definitions have been moved to ErrorCodes.h. in order to make them available also
in other modules like SecondoSystem.

December 2004, M. Spiekermann. A new function implementing the ~set~ command was added.

August 2005, M. Spiekermann. New private member ~isCSImpl~ supplemented.

December 2005, Victor Almeida deleted the deprecated algebra levels
(~executable~, ~descriptive~, and ~hibrid~). Only the executable
level remains. Models are also removed from type constructors.

August 2006, M. Spiekermann. Translation of error codes into messages has been
moved to the file SecondoInterfaceGenerla.cpp.  Documentation about error codes
and messages revised.

1.1 Overview

This module defines the procedure ~Secondo~ as defined in ``The Secondo
Project'' [G[ue]95]. The main procedure ~Secondo~ reads a command and
executes it. It possibly returns a result.

The first subsection describes the initialization and termination of the
interface.

The second subsection describes the various commands and the errors that
may occur for each of them.

The third subsection describes error handling and the specific error
codes; it makes error messages available in an array ~errors~.

The fourth subsection makes some procedures for type transformation and
information available, namely ~NumericTypeExpr~, ~GetTypeId~ and ~LookUpTypeExpr~.
~NumericTypeExpr~ transforms type expressions into a numeric form suitable
for writing application programs treating types in a generic way (e.g.
representation of values at the user interface). ~GetTypeId~ returns the
algebra and type identifier for a type.

Note that there have been some slight changes in respect to [G[ue]95]
in the treatment of the database state in database commands.

/*
Reads a command and executes it; it possibly returns a result.
The command is one of a set of "Secondo"[3] commands described below. The
parameters have the following meaning.

A "Secondo"[3] command can be given at various ~levels~; parameter
~commandLevel~ indicates the level of the current command. The levels
are defined as follows:

  * 0 -- "Secondo"[3] executable command in nested list syntax (~list~)

  * 1 -- "Secondo"[3] executable command in SOS syntax (~text~)

If the command is given in ~text~ syntax (command level 1),
then the text string must be placed in ~commandText~. If the command is
given in ~list~ syntax, it can be passed either as a text string in
~commandText~, in which case ~commandAsText~ must be "true"[4], or as a list
expression in ~commandLE~; in the latter case, ~commandAsText~ must be
"false"[4].

If the command produces a result (e.g. a query), then the result can be
requested to be returned either as a list expression (~resultAsText~ is
"false"[4]) in the parameter ~resultList~, or (~resultAsText~ is "true"[4]) in a
text file whose name is set to *SecondoResult* by default, but may be
overwritten.

Finally, the procedure returns an ~errorCode~ and error message. All error codes
are defined in file ~ErrorCodes.h~. They are explained below together with the
commands that may produce them. If an error occurred (~errorCode~ different from
0), then the complete error message will be given in parameter ~errorMessage~.
Possibly additional information about errors is given in the ~resultList~
which is then a list of errors with structure (ERRORS (e1 ...) ... (eN ...)) where
ej is an integer atom with an valid error code, refer to function ~WriteErrorList~
for details.

Furthermore, ~errorPos~ contains a position within the ~commandBuffer~
where the error was detected (only when the command was given in the
text buffer, of course). - not yet implemented. -

The second alternative is a short form for the ~text~ syntax without
the possibilty to specify a text file. Similary the third form is doing the
same with a command given as list.

Only if the function is called by an application, ~isApplicationLevelCommand~
should be set to ~true~ (default). This instructs the QueryProcessor to clear
its internal NL storage after processing the command, to copy all ~ListExpr~
values among the input and output parameters from the application's NL
storage to the QueryProcessor's internal NL storage, and to copy the results
from the internal NL storage to the application NL's storage.

For recursive calls, ~isApplicationLevelCommand~ should be set to ~false~, so
that the internal NBL storage is not invalidated when returning from a call.

2.1.1 Basic Commands

----  type <identifier> = <type expression>
      delete type <identifier>
      create <identifier> : <type expression>
      let <identifier> = <value expression>
      update <identifier> := <value expression>
      delete <identifier>
      query <value expression>
      if <value expression> then <command> [else <command>] endif

      (not yet implemented:)
      persistent <identifier>
----

*/

/*
All basic commands are only valid, if currently a database is open.

----  type <identifier> = <type expression>
----

Define a type name ~identifier~ for the type expression. Possible errors:

  * ~identifier~ already used

  * error in type expression

  * no database open

In case of error 5, an error list with further information is returned
in ~resultList~.

----  delete type <identifier>
----

Delete the type name ~identifier~. Possible errors:

  * ~identifier~ is not a known type name

  * type name is used by an object

  * no database open

----  create <identifier> : <type expression>
----

Create an object called ~identifier~ of the type given by ~type
expression~. The value is still undefined. Possible errors:

  * ~identifier~ already used

  * error in ~type expression~

  * no database open

In case of the second error, an error list with further information is returned
in ~resultList~.


----  update <identifier> := <value expression>
----

Assign the value computed by ~value expression~ to the object
~identifier~. Possible errors:

  * ~identifier~ is not a known object name

  * error in ~value expression~

  * ~value expression~ is correct, but not evaluable (e.g. a stream)

  * undefined object value in ~value expression~

  * type of value is different from type of object

  * no database open

----  delete <identifier>
----

Destroy the object ~identifier~. Possible errors:

  * ~identifier~ is not a known object name

  * no database open

----  query <value expression>
----

Evaluate the value expression and return the result as a nested list.
Possible errors:

  * error in ~value expression~

  * ~value expression~ is correct, but not evaluable (e.g. a stream)

  * undefined object value in ~value expression~

  * no database open

----  let <identifier> = <value expression>
----

Assign the value resulting from ~value expression~ to a new object
called ~identifier~. The object must not exist yet; it is created by
this command and its type is by definition the one of the value
expression. This object is temporary so far; it will be automatically
destroyed at the end of a session. Possible errors:

  * ~identifier~ already used

  * error in ~value expression~

  * ~value expression~ is correct, but not evaluable (e.g. a stream)

  * no database open


----
  NL-syntax: (if <value-expression> then <command> [else <command>] endif)
  Text-syntax: if <value-expression> then <command> [else <command>] endif
----

This is a conditional command. Depending on the value of the value-expresion,
either the first command is executed (value = TRUE) or not (value = FALSE).
If the optional else extension is used, its command is executed only if the
value-expression is FALSE. If the value-expression is undefined, none of the
commands is executed.

If the type of the value-expression is not ~bool~ or no database is opened,
the command fails with a syntax error.

----
  NL-syntax: (beginseq (command [| comand]*) endsec)
  Text-syntax: { command [| comand]* } or { }
----

This is a command sequence. The commands are executed one after another until
a command returns an error. Then, the execution of the sequence is stopped.
In this case, only the result, error code and error message of the *last*
executed command is returned. Other wise, a list (resultsequence R), where R is
a nested list with the commands' results in the given sequence is returned.

---
  NL-syntax: (while <value-expression> do <command> endwhile)
  Text-syntax: while <value-expression> do <command> endwhile
---

This is a while-do loop command. The parameter ~command~ is executed as long as
the ~value-expresion~, is evaluted to TRUE. If the value-expression gets
undefined or FALSE, ~command~ is not exececuted and the loop is exited.

If an error occurs, the result is always the result of the last executed
instance of ~command~. Otherwise it is a list (resultsequence R), where R is
a nested list with the results of all calls of
~command~.

If the type of the value-expression is not ~bool~ or no database is opened,
the command fails with a syntax error.

----  persistent <identifier>
----

Make the object ~identifier~ persistent, so that it will survive the end
of a session. Presumably this object was created by a ~let~ command
earlier. If it is not a temporary object, this command is not an error,
but has no effect. Possible errors:

  * ~identifier~ is not a known object name

  * no database open

*NOTE*: Beginning with version 2 of the "Secondo"[3] system all objects are
persistent by default. That is the ~persistent~ command is obsolete.

/*
2.1.2 Transaction Commands

----  begin transaction
      commit transaction
      abort transaction
----

These commands can only be used when a database is open. Any permanent
changes to a database can only be made within a transaction. Only a
single transaction can be active for this particular client at any time.

----  begin transaction
----

Start a transaction. Possible errors:

  * a transaction is already active.

  * no database open

----  commit transaction
----

Commit a running transaction; all changes to the database will be
effective. Possible errors:

  * no transaction is active.

  * no database open

----  abort transaction
----

Abort a running transaction; all changes to the database will be
revoked. Possible errors:

  * no transaction is active.

  * no database open

*NOTE*: All commands not enclosed in a ~begin transaction~ ...
~commit/abort transaction~ block are implicitly surrounded by a
transaction.

2.1.3 Database Commands

----  create database <identifier>
      delete database <identifier>
      open database <identifier>
      close database
      save database to <filename>
      save <objectname> to <filename>
      restore database <identifier> from <filename>
      restore <objectname> from <filename>
----

*NOTE*: All database commands can not be enclosed in a transaction.

The commands ~create database~ and ~delete database~ are only valid when
currently there is no open database ("IsDatabaseOpen() == false"[4]).
They leave this state unchanged.

The commands ~open database~ and ~restore database~ are only valid when
currently there is no open database ("IsDatabaseOpen() == false"[4]), the
database is open after successful completion.

The command ~close database~ is only valid if "IsDatabaseOpen() == true"[4].
No database is open after successful completion.

The command ~save database~ is only valid if "IsDatabaseOpen() == true"[4],
it leaves the state of the database unchanged.

----  create database <identifier>
----

Create a new database. Possible errors:

  * ~identifier~ already used

  * a database is open

----  delete database <identifier>
----

Destroy the database ~identifier~. Possible errors:

  * ~identifier~ is not a known database name.

  * a database is open

----  open database <identifier>
----

Open the database ~identifier~. Possible errors:

  * ~identifier~ is not a known database name.

  * a database is open

----  close database
----

Close the currently open database. Possible errors:

  * no database open

----  save database to <filename>

----  (OBJECTS
        (OBJECT <object name> (<type name>) <type expression>)*
      )
----

This is the same format as the one used in saving and restoring the
database except that the ~value~ component is missing. The type name is
written within a sublist since an object need not have a type name.
Possible errors:

  * no database open

----	list counters
----

Returns a nested list containing pairs of the form (<counter number> <counter
value>). Counters can be associated with operators within a query. The list
contains the counter values from the last query.
Possible errors:

  * no database open

----    list algebras
        ( inquiry ( algebras <valuelist> ) )
        E.G.: (inquiry (algebras
              (StandardAlgebra RelationAlgebra)))
----

Returns a list of the currently active included algebras at Secondo runtime.
Possible errors: none.

----    list algebra <algebraname>
        ( inquiry ( algebra <valuelist> ) )
        E.G.: (inquiry (algebra
               (RectangleAlgebra

1.3.1 Type transformation and information methods

The following procedure allows an application to transform a type
expression into an equivalent form with numeric codes. This may be
useful to provide type-specific output or representation procedures. One
can organize such procedures via doubly indexed arrays (indexed by
algebra number and type constructor number).

*/

  ListExpr NumericTypeExpr( const ListExpr type );
/*
Transforms a given type expression into a list structure where each type
constructor has been replaced by the corresponding pair (algebraId,
typeId). The catalog is used to resolve type names in the type expression.
For example,

----  int    ->    (1 1)

      (rel (tuple ((name string) (age int)))

      ->     ((2 1) ((2 2) ((name (1 4)) (age (1 1))))
----

Identifiers such as ~name~, ~age~ are moved unchanged into the result
list. If a type expression contains other constants that are not
symbols, e.g. integer constants as in "(array 10 real)"[4], they are also
moved unchanged into the result list.

The resulting form of the type expression is useful for calling the type
specific ~In~ and ~Out~ procedures.

	void InitRTFlags(const string& configFile);
/*
The first returns a reference to the application specific nested list container and
the second initializes the RTFlags found in the configuration file.

2.2 Error Messages

The function below returns a message string for a specific error message.

*/
  static string GetErrorMessage( const int errorCode,
		                 const ListExpr params = 0 );
/*

For a detailed explanation of all error code refer to the implementation in
file "SecondoInterfaceGeneral.cpp"[4].

For example the error codes  "ERR\_SPECIFIC\_KIND\_CHECKING\_ERROR"[4] and
"ERR\_SPECIFIC\_FOR\_TYPE\_CONSTRUCTOR" allow a kind checking procedure or an
~In~ procedure to introduce its own specific error codes (just numbered 1, 2,
3, ...). These error messages may then have further parameters. To interpret
such error messages (and return information to the user) one needs to add code
branching on these specific error code numbers. Such code should be provided in
the implementation of this function.


Background:

Some procedures which generate their own error messages have a
parameter ~errorInfo~ containing a pointer to the current last element
of ~errorList~. It appends the error message as a list with a command of
the form

----  errorInfo = Append(errorInfo, <message list>)
----

If errors are appended to the list within the execution of a "Secondo"[3]
command, then the list ~errorList~ is returned in parameter ~resultList~
of procedure ~Secondo~. This currently happens for the commands

----  type <identifier> = <type expr>
      create <identifier> : <type expr>
      restore database <identifier> from <filename>
----

since these commands involve kind checking and checking of value list
representations for objects. The messages that are appended to ~errorList~
usually have further parameters in addition to the error code number.

The next function expects a list of structure "(ERRORS (e1 ...) ... (en ...))"[4]
and translates error codes "ej" into messages. The result is written to
parameter ~ostr~.
