1 Header File: Secondo System

May 2002, Ulrich Telle. Port to C++.

August 2002, Ulrich Telle. Added methods to set and get the current algebra level.

April 29 2003, F. Hoffmann. Added save and restore commands for single objects.

April 2004 Hoffmann Changed some implementation details, so that the list databases 
command is available under Windows XP.

May 2004, M. Spiekermann. Function ~SaveDatabase~ was modified to left out derived objects.

Sept 15 2004, M. Spiekermann. Restore database returns now a value of type SI\_Error 
instead of an integer.

December 2005, Victor Almeida deleted the deprecated algebra levels
(~executable~, ~descriptive~, and ~hibrid~). Only the executable
level remains. Models are also removed from type constructors.

1.1 Overview

This module manages a set of databases. A database consists of a set of 
named types and a set of objects with given type name or type expressions. 
Objects can be persistent or not. Persistent objects are implemented 
by the ~Storage Management Interface~. When a database is opened, 
a catalog with informations about types, type constructors, operators, 
and objects of the database is loaded. Furthermore the catalog is loaded 
into memory by calling the procedures of the module ~Algebra Manager~.

1.2 Interface methods

The class ~SecondoSystem~ provides the following methods:

[23]    System Management & Database Management & Information    \\
        [--------]
        GetInstance       & CreateDatabase      & ListDatabaseNames \\
        StartUp           & DestroyDatabase     & IsDatabaseOpen \\
        ShutDown          & OpenDatabase        & GetDatabaseName \\
        GetAlgebraManager & CloseDatabase       &  \\
        GetQueryProcessor & SaveDatabase        &  \\
        GetCatalog        & RestoreDatabase     &  \\
        GetNestedList     &                     &  \\
                          &                     &  \\
