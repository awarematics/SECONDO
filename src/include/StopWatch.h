Small class for time measurement. Elapsed (real) time and used CPU time can
be computed according to a reference time defined by creation of the object or
by the start method. Times can be returnd as a double value representing seconds
or formatted as a string.

July 2004, M. Spiekermann. The class was created as replacement for calss TimeTest.
An instance could be used as a clock to measure time differences.
