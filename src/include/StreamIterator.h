1 Class StreamIterator 

The template class below can be used to iterate over input streams. It can be
typically used in operator implementations which operate on streams. It
encapsulates calls to the query processor. Since this is done very often in
many operator implementations it is a helpful tool for code reduction.

3 Overloaded Operators

The current value of an iterator "it"[1] can be referenced by the prefix star
operator and the next value can be requested by the postfix-"++" operation,
e.g. "it++"; example code for a stream iteration:

----
  StreamIterator<Tuple>( arg[0] );
  while( it.valid() ) {
    cout << *it << endl;
    it++;
  }
