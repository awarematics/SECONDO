# NOTE: -lpthread is neccessary on SuSe Linux 9.1. But there are two versions, one is 
# in the /lib directory and another in the /lib/tls directory. The same yields for
# other libraries. The berkeley db libraries use libraries in the /lib/tls directory.  
# and there is a dependency to the pthread library which doesn't appear on older
# Linux Systems. Maybe the reason is the change from Linux Kernel 2.4 to 2.6.
