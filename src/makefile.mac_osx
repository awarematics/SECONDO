# SECONDO makefile definitions for Mac OSX
#
#############################################

# Note: Currently we don't support MAC OSX. However, we
# invested some time to change the source code and makefiles
# in some places in order to make it happen that SECONDO can be
# compiled with MAC OSX using gcc 4.0. But the installation of all
# desired 3rd party tools may be complicated.
#
# If you also managed to build and run it on MAC OSX, please report it to
# secondo@fernuni-hagen.de
#
# Best Regards

# System dependent default libraries
DEFAULTLIB = -lpthread -lm -ldl -lstdc++

# NOTE: -lpthread is neccessary on SuSe Linux 9.1. But there are two versions, one is 
# in the /lib directory and another in the /lib/tls directory. The same holds for
# other libraries. The berkeley db libraries use libraries in the /lib/tls directory.  
# and there is a dependency to the pthread library which doesn't appear on older
# Linux Systems. Maybe the reason is the change from Linux Kernel 2.4 to 2.6.
