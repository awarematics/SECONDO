DEBUG = -ggdb

# The next flag instructs the preprocessor to report the hierachy
# of include instructions. 
#DEBUG += -Wp, -H

# Note: The flags below print out all defined symbols the preprocessor knows
# gcc -dM -E <file>

# Uncomment one of the next lines to compile with code optimizations. 
#OPTIMIZE = -O1 -finline-functions  -fearly-inlining -finline-limit=1800 -funit-at-a-time --param inline-unit-growth=300

#OPTIMIZE += -O3 -march=native

# Do not use assertions. 
# Assertions may
# only check logical constraints without doing any program
# logic! NEVER use functions having side-effects within an assert(...)!
#OPTIMIZE += -DNDEBUG  

# Uncomment next lines to generate profiling data used by gprof
# Run make realclean; make  
#DEBUG += -pg
#LDFLAGS += -pg

# Set up default flags for the compiler

# Flag for a persistent implementation of class NestedList. Remove the comment
# in the line below to use temporary Berkeley-DB record files instead of main
# memory. This is needed if you want to restore large objects.

# Flag for compiling code of operator value mappings which supports progress measurement. 
DEFAULTCCFLAGS += -DUSE_PROGRESS


# Flag for compiling code which uses serialization instead of copying class instances
# on block. After changing this flag you need to do a make clean, rebuild secondo, and
# restore your databases!

# only in some subordinated makefiles to avoid to many messages.
